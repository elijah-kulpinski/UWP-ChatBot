EDI COUNCIL SEDI COUNCIL Trina Patterson\nAssociate Director, Title IX, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion VISION STATEMENT\nThe University of WI-Parkside envisions a community where race, ethnicity,\nand other human differences are not predictors of success and\nwell-being. UWPs mission of providing high-quality educational programs, creative and\nscholarly activities, and services responsive to its diverse student population,\nand its local, national and global communities will be fully\nrecognized once we allow for opportunities of understanding and transformation.\nThe campus commits to: Establishing a narrative thread that connects\nand strengthens groups, events, and activities in order to counter\nthe structural biases that exist. Educating and building awareness about\nthe root causes of disparities and disproportionality in programs and\nsocial systems. Transforming systems that have upheld racial hierarchies. Celebrating\nour individual humanity and encourage vulnerability as a way of\nknowing. Creating a community dedicated to surfacing and constructively engaging\nsentiments that inhibit inclusivity and equity. Eliminating policies and practices\nthat continue to perpetuate racial disparities through systematic racism. Acknowledging\ndiversity is a strength and grants our stakeholders a pathway\nto understanding that differences are an asset. GUIDING PRINCIPLES JUSTICE\nDefinition Justice is the deliberate practice of dismantling structures and\nsystems that maintain historical and current inequities. This requires the\ncontinuous and proactive critique of current policies, practices, power structures,\ncultural messages, and social norms with the intent to achieve\nand sustain equity for all diverse identities. Aspiration UW-Parkside will\nactively engage in addressing issues of injustice both within and\noutside the institution. Resources are equitably allocated and all individuals\nhave access to information and structures of power. Individuals are\nphysically, psychologically, and emotionally safe and secure, and are empowered\nto become advocates for themselves and others. Equity Definition Equity\nis not the same as equality. Equity recognizes that we\ndo not all start from the same place and acknowledges\nand addresses historical and current imbalances. Aspiration Achieving equity demands\nthe institution continuously evaluate systems and structures and remove biases\nand barriers that impede an individual's holistic success at our\ninstitution. diversity Definition Representation of all the characteristics that make\nup human differences, including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity,\ngender and gender identity, sexual orientation, age, class, physical and\nmental ability, religion, political belief, national origin, and other social\nidentities represented in a space, community, institution, or society. Aspiration\nThe campus community reflects the different identities represented in the\nregion we serve, in all areas and levels of the\ninstitution. Promoting and acknowledging diverse perspectives and life experiences enhances\nthe learning environment for all. inclusion Definition Ensuring differences are\nwelcomed, different perspectives are respectfully heard, and every individual, especially\nthose who have been historically excluded because of their identities,\nfeels a sense of belonging. Aspiration Creating, fostering, and sustaining\npractices and conditions that encourage and allow each of us\nto be fully ourselves as we work and learn together.\nDiverse identities and experiences are invited, appreciated, and supported so\nthat all individuals feel that they belong at UW-Parkside and\nare respectfully heard and valued.

UW-Parkside\nChancellor Debbie Ford told the crowd of nearly 300: Nothing\nmakes me more proud as a leader than when people\nin our community recognize the strength and vibrancy of this\ncampus. They believe in our students and graduates so powerfully\nthat they step forward to make a significant investment in\ntheir success. Flickr photo gallery Alumni and friends of the\nuniversity gathered in the UW-Parkside Student Center Ballroom for the\nuniversitys premier 50th anniversary event. Proceeds from the 50 Years\nGala will help establish the Future Focus Scholarship. Tim Mahone,\npresident of the UW-Parkside Foundation Board of Directors called the\nestablishment of the Future Focus Scholarship a bold goal that\nwould make a lasting impact on student success for decades\nto come. UW-Parkside Foundation Board President Tim Mahone The foundation,\nMahone said, is committed to providing access to high-quality education\nfor the students and families of southeastern Wisconsin. The Future\nFocus Scholarship is a shared vision of the foundation to\nestablish the single largest fund specifically addressing student need. Were\ninvesting in our students so they are better prepared for\nall the opportunities to come. Johnson Financial Group and Snap-on\nIncorporated supported the 50 Years Gala as Anniversary Sponsors with\ncompany leaders Jim Popp and Nicholas Pinchuk serving as honorary\nco-chairs of the event. Foxconn and Kenosha Area Business Alliance\nprovided additional lead sponsorships. Support from the community is a\ntestament to relationships developed over the past half century, said\nJohn Jaraczewski, UW-Parkside assistant chancellor for University Advancement. UW-Parkside graduates\nprovide the talent and leadership companies and organizations need to\nsustain their own legacies of success. Michael Bond, supplier diversity\nmanager for Snap-on Incorporated, said his companys support for education\nis in its fabric. We are proud to have supported\nParkside through the decades  and Snap-on is proud to\nbe one of the first supporters of the Future Focus\nFund, Bond said. The Future Focus Fund will be there\nas a resource to meet the needs of hard-working students.\nPopp, who serves as president and chief executive officer at\nJohnson Financial Group, said the values and the purpose of\nUW-Parkside align with those of his company. For 50 years,\nUW-Parkside has invested in the growth, the health and the\nwell-being of our communities and the people who live here,\nPopp said. All of us at Johnson Financial Group are\nproud to be partners with UW-Parkside and we look forward\nto the next 50. The gala featured many perspectives on\nUW-Parksides past, present, and future. Alumna Rebekah Kowalski, a 1997\ngraduate now employed as vice president of client workforce solutions\nat ManpowerGroup, remarked on her experience and the impact of\nUW-Parkside faculty from numerous academic disciplines. All of them were\nworld-class and they challenged me to think about things differently,\nshe said. They challenged me to think about myself differently\nand they challenged me in ways that I had never\nanticipated. Terrill Taylor, a biological sciences major from Racine, shared\nthe ways in which UW-Parkside faculty have encouraged him to\nsucceed. He said the first years at UW-Parkside were challenging\n academically, emotionally and socially  partly because of his\nown expectations. I thought, because I am the only African\nAmerican in my science classes that my peers and my\nprofessors wouldnt take me seriously, Taylor said. I was hesitant\nto ask questions. I was insecure because I didnt want\nothers to think that I didnt know what I was\ntalking about. Terrill Taylor Rather than give up, Taylor sought\nadvice and guidance from UW-Parkside faculty. The professors at Parkside\nare truly amazing, Taylor said. I experienced nothing but support\nand care, and I always see their willingness to help\nwhenever I need it. Taylors success in the highly competitive\nand highly successful UW-Parkside pre-med program includes acceptance in the\nUW RUSCH program (Rural and Urban Scholars in Community Health)\nat the UW School of Medicine and Public Health. During\nthe RUSCH internship, Taylor studied with Dr. Tracy Downs, who\nis also African American. It was awesome building that relationship\nwith him and being taken under his wing, Taylor said.\nThis is just one of the opportunities I have been\nable to experience at UW-Parkside. Taylor is a scholarship recipient\nand acknowledged the importance of financial support. It really makes\nme happy to see you here tonight, he told the\naudience, taking time out of your lives to help students\nacross our campus get the support that they need to\nbe successful. Taylor introduced Dr. Bryan Lewis, associate dean in\nthe UW-Parkside College of Natural and Health Sciences. Taylor called\nLewis the person who helped him believe in himself. Taylor\nis not the only student Lewis has influenced. When I\nfirst came to UW-Parkside in the summer of 2000 we\nhad approximately 150 students in the pre-health program, Lewis said.\nNow we have well over 700. Over the past 17\nyears, 130 UW-Parkside students have applied to medical school and\n116 have been accepted. That is a 90 percent acceptance\nrate, Lewis said. The national acceptance rate for students across\nmedical schools in this country last year was 41.3 percent\n UW-Parksides success rate is 90 percent. Chancellor Ford concluded\nthe event by announcing anniversary fundraising progress, including a gift\nfrom Kathryn and Charles Heide Sr. of Somers, Wis., establishing\nthe C.P. and Anna Heide Endowed Scholarship. The Heide familys\ngenerous support will ensure that our university continues to be\na transformational place for more and more students, far into\nour future, Ford said. (l to r) Kathryn Heide, Kathy\nHeide, Tim Thompson, UW-Parkside Chancellor Debbie Ford, Charles Heide Sr.\nIn addition to the Future Focus Scholarship and the Heide\nEndowed Scholarship, donors to UW-Parkside and the UW-Parkside Foundation have\ncommitted more than $1 million in new gifts in honor\nof the universitys 50th anniversary. Tonight, weve raised more than\n$300,000 for the Future Focus Scholarship, Ford said, and we\nare still accepting investments in student success. Think of how\nmany UW-Parkside students will have their futures changed thanks to\nyou. Truly, we have much to celebrate. Fundraising and anniversary\ncelebrations continue throughout the 2018-19 academic year. The public is\ninvited to participate. For additional information, visit www.uwp.edu/50years.

Well, economics is\nthe study of making choices. What resources does an individual,\na company or a society use in light of social\nvalues and needs. Or in light of the scarcity of\nresources. One of the principal reasons to study economics is\nthat it develops a method of thinking and analysis that\ncan be directly applied in many different fields. At Parkside\nyou learn the principles and methods of economics and their\napplication to real-world problems. Request Information Visit Us Tuition and\nFees Apply Now! Economics provides a fundamental background for work\nin business, law, social science, and politics. Economics majors and\nminors develop skills to problem solve and analyze economic phenomena\nand make proficient economic decisions. In addition to core principles\nand theory, the Economics Department teaches a wide range of\nadvanced courses in various sub-fields of economics including industrial organization,\ninternational, public, and sports economics, and money and banking. There\nare two concentrations offered as well as the General Economics\nmajor track. Monetary and Financial Economics Concentration (21 credits) The\nmonetary and financial economics concentration is designed for students who\nare interested in professional positions in the financial and banking\nsectors. Quantitative Concentration (23 credits) The quantitative concentration is strongly\nrecommended for students who expect to study economics in graduate\nschool or seek a career using quantitative methods. Program Overview\nFour-Year Plan Course Schedule Department Site Learning in Action Economics\nstudents are in high demand for professional internships with major\ncorporations and businesses of all sizes. You can also participate\nin faculty research as an undergraduate student. Not many programs\noffer that exciting opportunity. Not only do economics students learn\nfrom top faculty, they also benefit from visiting scholars and\nguest speakers in the classroom and during special events by\nthe department, college, and the Economics Club student organization. Gain\nreal-world experience through the Ralph Jaeschke Solutions for Economic Growth\nCenter (SEG), a campus partnership with area businesses and nonprofit\norganizations.

The work provides a cost-effective solution for medium\nand small-sized organizations. Within SEG are specialty centers: Information Technology\nPractice Center Operations Management Specialty Center and Accounting and Finance\nSpecialty Center It's difficult to learn from a textbook how\nbusiness is conducted outside of the U.S. The Global Education\nCenter (GEC) evolved as a means to: provide students with\nfirst-hand experience through international study bring international experts and scholars\nto campus provide faculty members with opportunities to study abroad\nand recruit international students to Parkside. The Economics Department participates\nin the College Fed Challenge, a national economics competition sponsored\nby the Federal Reserve Bank.

Michael Haedt ('10) joined\nthe Internal Revenue Service in 2010 shortly after earning his\neconomics major from Parkside. Haedt says his job of revenue\nofficer isn't always popular, since it could mean shutting down\na business when tax liabilities exceed the ability to pay.\n\"An economics degree gives me an analytical view,\" he said.\n\"I have to make these decisions every day on whether\na business on the margin can turn it around.\" Haedt\nsaluted his professors for his success: \"They guided me from\nstep one. They were amazing; willing to tutor in the\nevenings if I needed additional help.\" PROGRAM CONTACT INFO Dennis\nKaufman | 262-595-2314 | economics@uwp.edu Adeel Faheem, PhD Assistant Professor\nAdeel Faheem holds a Ph.D. in economics from Kansas State\nUniversity.

On Friday, Oct. 13, the\nteam published a paper announcing the discovery of a new\nspecies of small, plant-eating dinosaur which they have named Ampelognathus\ncoheni (pronounced AM-pell-oh-nay-thuss KOH-hen-ee). The authors of the publication in\naddition to Dr. Noto are Dr. Ronald S. Tykoski (Perot\nMuseum), and Dr. Dori L. Contreras (Perot Museum). Their work\nappeared in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. In collaboration with\nDr. Noto, UW-Parkside biological sciences student Sammi Garside-Meyers has created\nscientifically-informed-artwork of Ampelognathus coheni for public outreach and education. She\nhas also assisted Dr. Noto with reconstructions of other organisms\nthat he is researching and creating learning opportunities for children\nin the form of coloring book pages. Garside-Meyers is a\nsenior from Pleasant Prairie majoring in biology. She got involved\nwith the project after another professor who she had done\nan illustration for informed her that Dr. Noto could use\nher artistic talents as well. When I finally got to\nmeet him, he told me he'd like me to illustrate\nfossil reconstructions. I thought that sounded fun, so I started\nworking with him and joined his lab doing both the\nreconstructions and some illustrations for the anatomy courses. This most\nrecent illustration is just one of many I have done\nover the past several months working with Dr. Noto, Garside-Meyers\nrecalls. With the guidance of Dr. Noto, Garside-Meyers role was\nto draw the reconstructions. Like each of the previous reconstructions\nI've done, I'm constantly reminded about how much guesswork there\ncan be when depicting an extinct animal. You do your\nbest with the knowledge you have but never forget you're\nprobably getting a lot of it wrong, she explains. Dr.\nNoto contends that scientifically-informed-artwork is very important due to the\nrarity of complete skeletons and the ambiguity that can create.\nDr. Noto explains, What a lot of people don't realize\nis that most extinct species are based on very fragmentary\nmaterialcomplete skeletons are very rare. Therefore, it can be hard\nto visualize what the animal looked like, especially when you\nhave so little of it. Scientifically-informed-artwork enables people to imagine\nwhat that organisms looked like and how it fit into\nits environment. I have worked with Sammi over the past\nyear to create a series of artistic reconstructions of Woodbine\nfossils that portray them as the living, breathing things they\nonce were. I certainly do not have the talent or\ntime to complete such a task and I am fortunate\nSammi reached out to me about opportunities in my research\nlab. She has been instrumental in bringing these ancient creatures\nback to life, Dr. Noto went on to say. Dr.\nNoto is an associate professor of biology in UW-Parksides biological\nSciences department. His areas of expertise are paleontology, paleobiology, fossils,\ndinosaurs, and evolution. Dr. Noto has collaborated with the Perot\nMuseum of Nature and Science in Dallas for 10 years\nand together they have explored various interesting fossil localities around\nthe Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. At one of the locations near\nthe spillway for Lake Grapevine, a museum volunteer found a\nsmall and unusual fossil that attracted the interest of Dr.\nNoto and his team. Further study by his colleagues determined\nthis specimen to be a new species of dinosaur. His\nexperience and expertise in the fossils of the area was\nessential to place the specimen into its proper context with\nwhat is known of the ancient community that existed there\nat that time. Ampelognathus coheni is the first small-bodied ornithopod\ndinosaur discovered from the Lewisville Formation (Middle Cenomanian) of Texas.\nIt is based on a partial lower jawbone discovered near\nGrapevine Lake, in Grapevine, Texas. The name Ampelognathus means Grapevine\njaw, and the species name coheni is in honor of\nthe local fossil enthusiast who found the specimen, Mr. Murray\nCohen. This dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous Period 96 million\nyears ago along the shore of a shallow seaway that\ndivided North America into east and west landmasses at the\ntime. According to Dr. Noto, the significance of this discovery\nis that it provides a previously missing but predicted element\nof that ancient ecosystem. Naming a new species is always\nexciting, because it means we're adding new information to science.\nAmpelognathus is important because it represents the first small-bodied plant-eater\nto be identified from the Woodbine Group. Up until this\npoint we had very few herbivores and only one of\nthem was a dinosaur, so it presented something of a\nmystery. This fossil helps fill in that gap and furthers\nour understanding of how the terrestrial ecosystem in the Woodbine\nwas structured over 95 million years ago, Dr. Noto explains.\nDonor Media Apply NowVisit CampusRequest InfoVirtual Tour CONNECT WITH US\nAccreditation University Police Campus Safety Giving Contact Us Calendar Apply\nCommunity Members Adult Learner UW-PARKSIDE AND THE BOARD OF REGENTS\nP 262-595-2345 Scroll to top",

Susan (Hillmer) Podlogar 84\nOur Winter Commencement speaker is Susan (Hillmer) Podlogar, who grew\nup in Racine and graduated from UW-Parkside in 1984 with\ndegrees in Labor and Industrial Relations and Business Administration. Susan\nearned her M.B.A. from the University of South Florida in\n1987 and has gone on to an impressive career in\nhuman resources at Fortune 100 companies such as Johnson &\nJohnson and MetLife where she currently serves as Chief Human\nResources Officer. Beyond her career success, Susan has given back\nto her community through her volunteer efforts in the arts\nincluding seven years on the Board of Trustees of the\nNew Jersey State Theatre. Susan and her husband, Brent Podlogar\n84, have established an endowed scholarship in the UW-Parkside Foundation\nto help future generations of students attend their alma mater.\nShe represents a wonderful example of a balanced life that\nwe hope all of our graduates can achieve. Susan was\nrecognized with a UW-Parkside Distinguished Alumni Award in 2018. Alumni\nRelations You may have noticed renewed emphasis on alumni relations\nover the past year. Engaging UW-Parkside alumni with students, faculty\nand each other will be critical to achieving our student\nsuccess goals as part of the UW-Parkside 2025 strategic framework.\nWe are positioning the Alumni Relations Office as a portal\nbetween the university and our graduates. We know that alumni\nwant to help the university and our students by being\nengaged in meaningful ways, and maintaining and developing lifelong relationships.\nYour partnership helps make this possible. Key to our alumni-engagement\nstrategy is collaboration with faculty, academic departments and other areas\nof campus such as admissions, career services, continuing education, athletics,\nstudy abroad and counseling. Building partnerships on shared activities and\ngoals will advance the universitys strategic mission. Not to be\nlost in this is the fact that alumni engagement and\nfundraising success are directly correlated. The Alumni Relations Office is\nalso leading (and in some cases, launching!) a number of\nefforts for alumni: Communications to foster connection and to inform\nalumni so that they can be loud and proud advocates\nfor UW-Parkside: monthly e-news, academic department news, and the new\nParkside: The Magazine (mailed twice a year). Each department on\ncampus will receive a print copy, and its also available\nonline: uwp.edu/magazine. Affinity groups and activities to allow alumni to\nconnect with each other and with faculty and staff: Alumni\nevents, groups at companies with significant alumni employee presence. Alumni\nAwards to recognize alumni achievements and service to the community.\nWe plan to measure the success of alumni engagement efforts\nwith the following metrics: Number of alumni volunteering Number of\nstudents utilizing alumni mentors/coaches (more to come on this effort\nin the spring) Number of alumni visiting faculty members Number\nof alumni making a gift to the University each year\nIt will take a village to engage our alumni in\nmeaningful ways and to feel the impact of a stronger\nalumni community throughout the institution. We will keep you informed\nof ways that you can be involved in our shared\nalumni relations efforts. Three items for now: Nominate an alum\nfor the UW-Parkside Distinguished Alumni Awards, by Dec. 13 Let\nus know when you host alumni on campus or they\nare involved with the campus community. Guest lectures, visits with\na favorite former faculty members, and more. Drop a note\nto alumni@uwp.edu and well provide an alumni swag bag to\nwelcome them back and thank them for their engagement. Save\nthe date for Parkside Day: March 5, 2020. The second\nannual Parkside Day will engage alumni and the community in\ncelebrating and supporting UW-Parkside. You can help us spread the\nword and make it a success. Thanks for reading this\nupdate and for any thoughts you may have on alumni\nengagement.

Hora, Matias Scaglione, Emily Parrott, Zi Chen, Matthew\nWolfgram and Arun Kolar, Center for College and Workforce Transitions,\nUniversity Of WisconsinMadison, December 2018. Facilities Management & Capital Projects\n| December 2, 2019 Colleagues: The 2014 Campus Master Plan\nrecommended an ambitious and necessary transformation of the academic core\nfacilities. The previous master plan guided the renovation and expansion\nof the Student Center and the Rita Tallent Picken Regional\nCenter for Arts and Humanities. These buildings are state-of the-art\nfacilities that continue to serve the university as it evolves\nand grows. Renovating the academic core of the campus \nWyllie, Greenquist, and Molinaro Halls  is a priority in\nthe 2014 Campus Master plan to meet our current and\nfuture needs. Following is a list of projects that are\nin the planning process and scheduled over the next two\nyears. Wyllie Renovation  Phase I (estimated to start May\n2020) Most of the focus of this project is updating\nthe infrastructure and mechanical systems on the D2, D1, and\nL1 levels of Wyllie Hall. Even though most of the\nimprovements are behind the walls, we are using this renovation\nas an opportunity to make much needed improvements to the\nenrollment and support services area on the D1 level. You\nwill also see improved access to the library. The project\nis scheduled to begin next spring with substantial completion in\nMay of 2022. Greenquist Science Labs 222/370 (estimated to start\nJune 2020) This project will provide campus and students with\ninteractive, state-of-the-art, biological sciences instructional labs by upgrading these labs\nto current teaching best practices, and improve the efficiency and\noperation of the electrical and HVAC systems that serve the\nspace. Central Utility Tunnel Repair  Phase II (estimated to\nstart May 2020) Project work includes repairing leaks in the\nenclosure, repairing spalling concrete enclosure surfaces, and repairing adjacent utility\ndistribution piping, valves, and valve boxes. The project also includes\nwaterproofing of the D2 level utilidors between Wyllie Hall/Greenquist Hall\nand Wyllie Hall/Rita Tallent Picken Regional Center. Fire Alarm System\nUpgrade (estimated to start June 2020) This project replaces and\naugments the campus-wide fire alarm and smoke detection system across\n16 facilities to meet current life safety code and accessibility\nstandards, improve reliability and features, and reduce operational maintenance costs.\nPool Basin Infill (estimated to start April 2020) The focus\nof this project is to convert the swimming pool area\ninto a multi-functional space that can be used by sports\nteams, students, and the community for a variety of activities.\nSpecifics as to how this space will be used has\nnot yet been finalized. SAC Parking Lot Repairs (estimated to\nstart June 2020) A curb and gutter system will be\ninstalled on the eastern edge of the parking lot. The\nsystem will carry storm water and snow melt from the\nhigher eastern edge of the parking lot to a drainage\nditch on the western end of the lot. The parking\nlot will be milled, compacted, and a new layer of\nasphalt will be applied. SAC Bleacher Replacement (estimated to start\nJune 2020) Project work includes removing the old bleachers and\ninstalling two new powered platform seating systems with seat backs\nthat are anticipated to accommodate a slightly reduced seating capacity.\nThe new seating systems will include new controls, self-storing railings,\nside curtains, and the ability to accommodate a media platform.\nFacilities Management has a lot going on. You will note\nthat construction of all these projects starts next spring. Thank\nyou in advance for your patience as these projects get\nunder way. The disruption will be worth it as we\ncontinue to transform our facilities, providing a first-class learning environment\nfor students. Scott Menke Vice Chancellor for Finance & Administration\nOur Engaged Campus | November 25, 2019 Colleagues: Last week\nI had the pleasure of attending an alumni event at\nCNH headquarters in Racine. The company invited its more than\n120 employees who are UW-Parkside alumni to meet and reconnect\nwith members of our UW-Parkside learning community. CNH, along with\nother leading employers in our area such as Uline, Snap-on,\nJohnson Financial, Aurora, Ascension, Jockey, SC Johnson, Modine  and\nmany others  know the important value of UW-Parkside alumni.\nGraduates who are contributing in our communities are the foundation\nof community engagement that is a hallmark of our university.\nThere are many other ways in which UW-Parkside connects and\nmakes a difference in southeastern Wisconsin and around the state.\nPASS THE CRANBERRIES As we approach the holiday season, you\nmay find cranberries on the dinner tables of family and\nfriends. Did you know that Wisconsin is the nations largest\nproducer and processor of cranberries? Research being conducted by Associate\nProfessor of Chemistry Dr. Frannie Mann and her students will\nhelp Wisconsins cranberry industry extract a higher percentage of important\nantioxidants from the pulp, skin and seeds of the cranberries\nafter processing. THE BUZZ Congratulations to Dr. Julie Kinzelman, associate\nlecturer in our sustainable management program, who earned the Root\nPike Watershed Initiative Network BEE Positive Award.

A GREAT SEASON Congratulations to our mens soccer team.\nThe Rangers won the GLIAC conference championship and the GLIAC\ntournament. In the first round of the NCAA Super Regional\nlast week in Kentucky against Cedarville, the score was knotted\nat 0-0 following regulation play. That meant penalty kicks would\ndecide the winner. Hats off to Cedarville which scored 5\nkicks to the Rangers 4. An amazing game! HERA Im\nhonored that UW-Parkside is a founding member of the Higher\nEducation Regional Alliance (HERA) along with 17 other institutions of\nhigher education in southeastern Wisconsin  including our partners Carthage\nCollege and Gateway Technical College. At the official HERA launch\nin October, members shared the important vision and mission of\nresponding to the diverse needs of employers in our communities.\nThat is what makes HERA so vital  it takes\nthe collaboration of area colleges and universities to successfully meet\nthe talent and innovation demands of the region. Working together,\nwell provide the leadership and results to keep our region\nmoving forward. Thank you for all you do each day\nto help our students succeed, and for your efforts to\nconnect our campus with the community. Enjoy the holiday season\n remember only 19 shopping days until Commencement! Debbie Ford\nChancellor HIPs Ideas! | November 18, 2019 Colleagues, Our Academic\nPlan refers to the insight from George Kuhs scholarship that\nthe more time and energy students devote to their university\nexperience, the more likely they are to obtain the desired\noutcomes of an undergraduate education,[i] first among them, persistence and\ndegree completion. Engagement-building teaching techniques, or high impact practices (HIPs),\ninclude, for example, undergraduate research, community-based learning, internships, and capstone\ncourses and projects. A three-year grant from the National Association\nof System Heads (NASH) to support HIPs has helped us:\nadopt learning goals, a common rubric, and assessment for community-based-learning\n(CBL); develop a CBL course designation process that 38 courses\nhave passed with more in the queue; fund a $500\nstipend for each CBL-designated course taught; offer a CBL Fellows\nprogram to 17 colleagues; deliver a seminar, Diversity in the\nCollege Classroom, to 12 students, 26 non-instructional staff, and 9\nfaculty/instructors; present a new Internship Workshop with 10 faculty/instructor participants;\ninventory current internship and campus employment practices; approve a common\ndefinition for internships; appoint a new Faculty Director for Internships\n(Theresa Castor) and a Campus Employment Specialist (Mary Waid); and\nform a team to pilot turning campus employment into a\nhigh impact practice. In the goal-setting effort for the Academic\nPlan, five of six constituent groups surveyed, all except students,\nindicated increasing student success through strengthening high impact pedagogical practices\nwas one of their top five Academic Plan goals. Students,\nthe Plan noted, may be unfamiliar with the high impact\ndesignation and might explain why they gave this goal less\nemphasis. On the other hand, they did emphasize two highly\nrelated Academic Plan goals: Build career knowledge and planning into\ncurricula, and Increase career relevance of programs. These are widely\nunderstood as high impact, engagement-building strategies from students points of\nview.[ii] They also suggest two opportunities. The first is to\nensure all our students have at least two HIPs experiences\nas undergraduates. This is an Academic Plan goal and an\naim in the UW System 2020FWD Strategic Framework. Our data\nindicate that 7-in-10 UW-Parkside graduates do and most occur when\nstudents are juniors and seniors.[iii] Since we lose about 45\npercent of our first-time, full-time freshman by the junior year\n(ugh!), if we design HIPs experiences that reach more lower-division\nstudents, we hope to grow retention and continue to improve\ngraduation rates. The second has to do with internships. An\nimportant gateway experience to prepare students for post-graduate employment, internships\nfor most UW-Parkside undergraduates just dont work. Each year, well\nunder 10 percent of our students do an internship for\ncredit. In a 2018 survey conducted by the Center for\nCollege and Workforce Transitions at UW-Madison, 61 percent of UW-Parkside\nstudent respondents indicated the biggest barrier to doing internships is\nhaving a job.[iv] What if, with learning goals specified, a\nset of academic deliverables, faculty and staff supervision that is\ncompensated, and the approval of employer supervisors, we would award\nacademic credit for selected non-internship work our students already do?\nThis would remove the structural barrier our students face in\nobtaining academically guided work experience for credit, help them progress\ntoward degree-completion, and strengthen university-employer collaboration in talent development, a\ncritical economic development challenge in our region. A team of\nfaculty and staff is collaborating in a study with the\nCenter for College and Workforce Transitions in the coming months\nto explore the possibilities. Thanks for reading this far.

[iv]Results from the\nCollege Internship Study at University of Wisconsin-Parkside, Matthew T. Hora,\nMatias Scaglione, Emily Parrott, Zi Chen, Matthew Wolfgram and Arun\nKolar, Center for College and Workforce Transitions, University Of WisconsinMadison,\nDecember 2018. Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity | November 11,\n2019 Did you know that as of today there are\n24 active grants and sub-awards on our campus? Total funding\nfor the private grants is just over $700,000 and total\nfunding for federal awards is nearly $3.6 million over the\nlife of the funding periods. Funding organizations include the National\nScience Foundation, WiSys, the UW System, and the federal Department\nof Education. One of the most important ways we support\nfaculty and staff research and enhance the experience of our\nstudents is through our focus on undergraduate research and creative\nactivity. Under the leadership of Dave Higgs (Biological Sciences) and\nwith funding from the Provosts Office we provide this support\nin a number of ways. In 2018-2019, 45 students received\nfunding from the Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP). In the\ncurrent semester, we are supporting 15 URAP students. During each\nspring semester we provide support for students and their faculty\nmentors to attend the National Council on Undergraduate Research (NCUR)\nconference, the UW System Undergraduate Research Symposium, and the annual\nResearch in the Rotunda event held at the State Capitol.\nLast year, nine students and two faculty attended the NCUR\nconference at Kennesaw State University near Atlanta, 51 students and\nsix faculty attended the UW System event at UW-Green Bay,\nand six students presented their work to legislators in the\nCapitol. Finally, last April, our own UW-Parkside Student Showcase highlighted\nthe work of 115 students. We are excited about some\nnew partnerships with WiSys. As you have heard, Deborah Lundin\nis now working with faculty and staff seeking grant support.\nDeborah adds to the excellent work already being done by\nTina Radley. WiSys also provided funding for two UW-Parkside faculty\nto attend the Council on Undergraduate Research grant writing workshop\nthis past summer. Finally, UW-Parkside has committed up to $10,000\nper year in matching funds to support faculty research through\nthe WiSys Spark program. Two long-standing programs that support research\nand dissemination of research results are also worth noting. Last\nyear, the Committee on Research and Creative Activity distributed $29,990\nto faculty, and the Faculty and Academic Staff Professional Opportunity\nFund provided $29,736 to faculty and academic staff. Finally, the\nProvosts Office is hosting a new Third Friday event highlighting\nfaculty research and creative activity. Michael Hansen (Politics-Philosophy-Law) and William\nParker (Mathematics & Physics) were featured in September, Susan Lincke\n(Computer Science) and John Navarro (Criminal Justice) presented in October,\nand Jonathan Shailor (Communication) and Dana Oswald (English) are scheduled\nfor November. Gary Wood Vice Provost of Academic Affairs Environmental\nSustainability | November 4, 2019 Striving to be a greener\ncampus and championing sustainability efforts has always been a big\npart of our culture here at UW-Parkside. From the very\nbeginning, the plan for the campus was to be environmentally\nresponsible, including the preservation of large areas of natural landscape.\nAn excerpt from the 2014 Master Plan reads: The landscape\nwas a key component of the original 1969 Master Development\nPlan concept of a Machine in the Garden. The quality\nof the campus setting, in conjunction with Petrifying Springs Park\nprovides a significant open space preserve and outdoor recreation asset\nfor southeast Wisconsin. Today, that culture and sense of responsibility\ntoward sustainability and the environment remain strong. Yes, traditional recycling\ncontinues to be part of our sustainability efforts, but taking\ncare of our natural resources and reducing our carbon footprint\nis just as important. Here are just a few examples\nof our recent efforts to be good stewards of our\nresources. Recycling Did you know we recycle over 100 tons\nof paper, cardboard, plastic, aluminum, and glass annually in addition\nto over 6 tons of e-waste (computers, monitors, appliances, etc.)?\nThese efforts roughly translate into resource savings of: 1,362 mature\ntrees 373 cubic yards of landfill space 164,661 kWh \nenough to power 15 homes 368 metric tons of CO2\n635,600 gallons of water  enough to provide 8,475 people\nwith freshwater for a year Pike River Restoration On May\n23, 2019, we signed an agreement to partner with Kenosha\nCounty allowing the County Parks Department to assist in the\nmanagement of approximately 139 acres of our campus adjacent to\nPetrifying Springs Park. In addition to managing the various trails\non the property and protecting sensitive research areas used by\nour faculty and students, the County has agreed to obtain\nfinancial resources to restore the ecology of the Pike River\nand improve the surrounding flood plain. These efforts will significantly\nimprove the Pike River watershed and allow the County to\nbetter manage flood mitigation, erosion, stormwater runoff, water quality, and\nhabitat improvements. Partnering with Root-Pike Watershed Initiative Network Root-Pike WIN\nis a nonprofit organization with a mission to improve the\nfive major watersheds in southeastern Wisconsin that drain into Lake\nMichigan. With a plan to leverage grant resources designed to\nimprove watershed management as well as resources to protect the\nhabitat of the endangered rusty patched bumble bee, Root-Pike WIN\nis partnering with UW-Parkside to improve the quality of the\nWayne E. Dannehl National Cross County Course. In addition to\ncourse improvements, we are exploring opportunities to work with Root-Pike\nWIN on projects to enhance our campus stormwater management. These\nprairie, wetland, and woodland restorations align with the long-term goals\nof the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and meet objectives set\nforth in the campus master plan. Solar Array WE Energies\napproached campus administration seeking to partner on its Solar Now\nproject. Discussions led to an agreement allowing WE Energies to\nlease approximately 8.4 acres of land on the east side\nof the UW-Parkside campus to construct a 2.25-megawatt solar array\nfor the regional electric grid. To put it into perspective,\nthe campus uses approximately 3.5 megawatts of electricity annually. It\nis projected the lease arrangement will generate between $2.2 million\nto $2.5 million over the 30-year lease period. Construction is\nanticipated to begin next summer. Land Management Committee With all\nthe opportunities involving our natural land resources, it seemed prudent\nto create a land management committee to help guide and\ndirect our land-management efforts. Protecting, maintaining, and improving our natural\nland resources are goals evident to anyone who reads our\ncampus master plan. Providing resources that can be used by\nour staff and students, and enjoyed by members of our\ncommunity is a top priority. The committee consisting of seven\nfaculty and three staff take their charge seriously, seeking to\nmake our campus the best it can be. Scott Menke\nVice Chancellor for Finance and Administration HR Initiatives | October\n28, 2019 Talent Attraction Employee Engagement Diversity and Inclusion Our\nfacilities team provides a safe, clean and inviting physical environment;\nour students provide a vibrancy not found in other workplaces;\nand each of us has the amazing opportunity to transform\nlives. Lets take a quick look at some of the\ngreat things happening in the world of Human Resources here\nat UW-Parkside! In support of the mission, values, and aspirations\nof the university, the work of HR is focused on\ncreating a positive campus culture and supporting the talent, development,\nengagement, health, and well-being of faculty and staff. Together we\ncan achieve high performance and that means positive outcomes for\nour students. In alignment with and support of the UW-Parkside\n2025 Strategic Framework, our HR team has developed the following:\nHR Initiatives Talent Attraction (Recruitment): We have reorganized the HR\nDepartment to improve recruiting efforts by providing more effective support\nto the colleges and departments. Well be working closely with\ncolleges and departments to assess recruitment requirements and expectations. This\ninformation will help us create a more robust recruitment model\nthat offers more flexibility and will be supported with strong\nHR service delivery and processes. Diversity and Inclusion: UW-Parkside HR\nis committed to supporting our students, faculty, and staff and\nenhancing our climate of equity and inclusion so that all\nmembers of our campus community are empowered to do their\nbest. Over the next few months, the HR team \nin conjunction with students, faculty, and staff  will work\nto develop a diversity and inclusion strategic plan. The goal\nis to identify and implement best practices designed to promote\nand support the success underrepresented populations and to foster a\nclimate of inclusivity. Sheronda Glass Assistant Vice Chancellor Human Resources,\nEmployee Engagement and a proud member of Team HR! Status\nof Women Report and More | October 21, 2019 In\nfall 2018, two groups of community and education leaders from\nacross Kenosha and Racine came together to conduct research, gather\ndata and to raise awareness of the challenges, opportunities, and\nsocial issues facing girls and women in Kenosha and Racine.\nProfessor Emeritus Norm Cloutier led the research team of UW-Parkside\nfaculty from economics, sociology, psychology, geography, political science, criminal justice,\nhealth and exercise science, business, and education. Chancellor Debbie Ford\nled the advisory committee with a goal to set the\nstage to move the needle in closing gaps and improving\nequity for girls and women in Kenosha and Racine. The\nresearch team used The Status of Women in your County:\nA Community Research Tool to gather data and information on\neducation, health and well-being, business ownership, crime, labor, poverty, political\nrepresentation, and demographics in Kenosha and Racine. The research team\nand advisory committee created an interactive website to showcase the\ndata, reports, references, and regional resources for girls and women.\nDebbie Ford Chancellor Progress on Student Success | October 14,\n2019 In fall 2016, the Provost built on the existing\nacademic plan through a consultative process that helped narrow a\nlarge number of goals to four considered most important. Teams\nthen developed strategies for each goal and the resulting plan\nwas adopted by the Faculty Senate on Oct. 24, 2017.\nOf the goals considered, increasing retention and graduation rates, how\nwe typically measure student success, was the only goal included\nin the top five ranking of every constituent group surveyed:\nfaculty, instructional academic staff, non-instructional academic staff, university staff, students,\nand senior administrators. The average six-year graduation rate since UW-Parksides\nfirst graduating class in 1973 has been 26.4 percent. The\nsix-year rates for the most recent three annual cohorts have\nclimbed steadily and set new highs each year: 34.0 percent,\n38.1 percent, and 44.5 percent. The most recent graduation rate\nis 69 percent above the historic average and a 31\npercent increase in three years. Beyond growth in graduation rates,\nthere is also evidence of extraordinary student learning across our\nfour colleges at UW-Parkside: close to 90 percent acceptance rates\ninto health science professional programs; student-developed award-winning software applications adopted\nby regional organizations; compelling performances in theatre and music; and\nhigh levels of student engagement and voting in national elections.\nAll these attest to transformational learning and the work of\nour faculty and staff. The environment we face in public\nhigher education is not, of course, without challenges. As the\ncost of a higher education has grown, so too has\ncriticism of our ability to change, be accountable, or serve\nstudents from marginalized backgrounds. We wish to share two thoughts\nas academic and administrative leaders. First, UW-Parksides role is as\nimportant as ever and, second, we must continue to focus\non improving student success. Most students in the U.S. earn\nbachelors degrees at public institutions like UW-Parkside, close to where\nthey live. A 2019 report from the American Enterprise Institute,\nIs the University Next Door the Way to Upward Mobility?,\ndemonstrates that over half the low-income students enrolled at 307\ncomprehensive universities reached the two highest earner quintiles by their\nearly 30s. There were two other relevant findings. First, considerable\nvariation exists in the post-graduate earnings of students from different\nuniversities in the sample. Second, the factor most highly associated\nwith differences in earnings is college completion rates. These robust\nfindings reaffirm the power of universities like ours to fuel\nupward mobility, as well as the importance of continuing to\nfocus on improving graduation rates. And while our highest-ever graduation\nrate of 44.5 percent is encouraging, it remains below the\nnational average and gaps do remain amongst different groups. The\nsix-year rate is 32.3 percent for underrepresented minority students, 39.6\npercent for Pell-eligible students, and 42.0 percent for first-generation students.\nSo, to continue to improve the career and life prospects\nof all our students, improving their chances of graduating --\nespecially students from groups historically underserved by higher education --\nis necessary. Consider as well that 43 percent of the\nincoming fall 2019 class at UW-Parkside are students of color.\nWhile there are no magic bullet solutions, the strategies we\nare implementing reflect best practices and collectively seem to be\nworking. As an example of whats possible: In 2003, Georgia\nStates six-year graduation rates for African American and Hispanic students\nwere 25.6 percent and 22.0 percent, respectively. From 2008 to\n2017, students of color went from 53 percent to 67\npercent of their enrollees. Over the same period, the percent\nof their students eligible for Pell grants went from 32\npercent to 59 percent, average SAT scores declined 33 points,\nand state appropriations decreased by $40 million. In spite of\ntrends typically associated with lower graduation rates, Georgia State increased\nthe number of degrees awarded annually by 67 percent, and\nincreased six-year graduation rates for African American and Hispanic students\nto 77.5 percent and 76.7 percent, respectively![i] The list of\nstrategies that Georgia State and universities across the U.S. are\nadopting, include those in UW-Parksides Academic Plan, include -- 15-to-finish\nto ensure sufficient credit momentum to support timely graduation; Math\nPathways that tailor students math requirements to their majors; Co-requisite\nRemediation that reduce students sense that theyre starting out behind\nby scheduling developmental math work concurrent to the credit-bearing requirement;\na new advising model and data analytics platform to support\nmore effective and efficient interventions; the new Parkside Promise+ Program\nto attract and support students least able to afford a\nhigher education; enhanced mentoring focusing on students of color; meta-majors\nto make initial choices easier and help ensure subsequent and\ninevitable changes are less likely to result in wasted credit,\nadded time, and added cost; student-focused scheduling to optimize course\navailability; stereotype reducing and belonging-increasing interventions because students feelings affect\ntheir performance; and a full complement of faculty and staff\ndevelopment programming to support these initiatives. Debbie Ford, Chancellor Rob\nDucoffe, Provost Gary Wood, Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Tammy\nMcGuckin, Vice Provost for Student Affairs and Enrollment Services DeAnn\nPossehl, Assistant Provost for Student Success John Skalbeck, Interim Chair,\nUniversity Committee Proud, Forward, Together | October 7, 2019 Happy\nMonday, Rangers! Proud. Forward. Together. At the beginning of the\nyear, I asked our student-athletes and coaches to join me\nthis year in embracing the mindset of Proud. Forward. Together.\nDuring the 2019-20 season, we are focused on being proud.\nProud of representing our university and our state as Wisconsins\nDivision II institution, proud of our 15 intercollegiate sport programs,\nproud of our teammates, and for each of us as\nindividuals, proud of our backgrounds, experiences, successes, adversities, and hard\nwork that brought up to this opportunity to be Rangers.\nWe are focused on a Forward mindset. When we succeed\nin competition or in the classroom, we take time to\ncelebrate, but we are focused on shifting forward to prepare\nfor our next opportunity. When facing adversity or challenges, were\nfocused on learning from these experiences and shifting forward. Finally,\nand most importantly, we are focused on Together  coming\ntogether, keeping together, and working together. Were excited to embrace\nthis challenge in 2019-20, to come together, keep together, and\nwork together as a team, a department, a University, and\nwith our campus community. GLIAC Management Council Today and tomorrow,\nwe are thrilled to be welcoming colleagues from across the\nGreat Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference to our campus and our\ncommunity for the GLIAC Management Council Fall Meetings.

Go Rangers!\nAndrew Gavin Director of Athletics New Programs | September 30,\n2019 Digital Programs in the Arts and Humanities Arts and\nHumanities students need to be prepared for an increasingly digital\nworld. The College of Arts and Humanities has launched three\nnew programs to meet this need: a concentration in Contemporary\nand Commercial Music, a certificate in Digital Design and Fabrication,\nand a certificate and minor in Digital Media and Production.\nTo support these programs, we have created new facilities for\ndigital music technology, digital design and CNC production, and digital\naudio and video production. Health Care Related Programs Health care,\nincluding mental health care, is a burgeoning employment area in\nsoutheast Wisconsin. To respond to the need for graduates skilled\nin these areas, the College of Natural and Health Sciences\nis offering three new programs: an M.S. in Health Care\nAdministration, an M.S. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, and a\nconcentration in Medical Lab Science in the Applied Health Sciences\nmajor. The Health Care Administration program is a collaborative online\nprogram, and Medical Lab Science is being delivered in partnership\nwith Froedtert South. Clinical Mental Health Counseling has been a\nsignificant driver of graduate student enrollment, with 33 students enrolled\nin only its second year. Professional and Business Program Southeast\nWisconsin is experiencing an economic boom, creating demand for employees\nwith a variety of skill sets. A number of new\ngraduate programs have been or are in the process of\nbeing created to serve this need. These include six new\nmasters programs in Applied Professional Studies, Sport Management, Information Technology\nManagement, Applied Biotechnology, Professional Communication, and Cybersecurity. All are fully\nonline and accessible to working professionals. Applied Professional Studies and\nSport Management are already enrolling students. IT Management and Applied\nBiotechnology will begin enrolling students in the spring. Professional Communication\nand Cybersecurity are in the approval process and are planning\na fall 2020 launch. UW-Parkside has also become a major\nplayer in the UW Flexible Option program. We have been\noffering the Project Management certificate, and were recently chosen to\npartner with UW Extended Campus to offer the B.S. in\nBusiness Administration degree in the UW Flexible Option format. As\nof July, just over 90 students were enrolled in our\nFlex programs. Education Since 2014, and for the first time\nin our history, UW-Parkside now offers majors in Education. Responding\nto the needs of our local school districts and in\ncollaboration with them, we now offer majors in Early Childhood\nEducation (a collaborative program with Gateway Technical College), Elementary Education,\nSecondary Education, and Special Education, as well as licensure programs\nin ESL and Bilingual Education. Smart Cities A unique new\nprogram, certainly the only one in the state and perhaps\nin the nation, is the new graduate certificate in Smart\nCities Policy and Civic Partnerships. Developed by faculty in the\nCollege of Social Sciences and Professional Studies, this program establishes\nUW-Parkside as a key player in the new age of\ndigital technology and the range of new opportunities technology provides\nfor communities to improve the lives of its citizens. Online\nMBA As highlighted in last weeks update, a significant driver\nof the enrollment increase is the online M.B.A. program. That\nprogram was substantially revised by faculty in the College of\nBusiness, Economics, and Computing to include such new concentrations as\nData Analytics, Finance, Marketing, Global Management, and Supply Chain. All\ncourses are offered in seven-week formats creating six start times\nannually for working professionals. At last count, 238 students were\nenrolled in the MBA online. Online Programs to Serve the\nReturning Adult Student Market In addition to the new online\nmasters degree programs, UW-Parkside faculty and staff have worked to\ncreate an array of new online bachelors degree-completion programs for\nthe some-credits, no-degree market. These include collaborative programs in Sustainable\nManagement and in Health Information Technology and Management, and our\nown homegrown programs in Business, Sociology and Liberal Studies. All\nof this work has involved the efforts of hundreds of\nUW-Parkside faculty and staff. Kudos to all of you! Your\nwork has resulted in stronger ties to our community and\nbusiness partners, the first enrollment increase in many years, and\na bright future for our institution. Gary Wood Vice Provost\nfor Academic Affairs Matriculations and Money | September 23, 2019\nIt is a sign of the times that we emphasize\nmatriculations and money. While our Strategic Framework and our Academic\nPlan remind us that were not doing it for the\nmoney, we do need sufficient resources to fund proposed changes.\nOur vision at UW-Parkside is to transform lives and improve\nstudent success. Our region needs us to do more of\nboth to flourish in this century. Thats why weve committed\nto producing 50 percent more graduates annually by 2025. To\ndo that, were going to need to serve more students\nand increase compensation for our faculty and staff, both goals\nin our plans. A March 22, 2019, memo (posted on\nthe Academic Plan Updates page) noted that from 2008 to\n2018, growth in annual graduates from UW-Parkside outpaced UW System-wide\ngrowth by 48 percent (16.9 percent vs 11.4 percent). Over\nthe same 10-year period, however, our headcount enrollment fell 16.6\npercent (5,167 to 4,308 students) while the UW Comprehensives collectively\ngained 3.4 percent. The enrollment trend is changing. Last fall,\nour headcount enrollment was up 0.7 percent over the previous\nyear. In spring 2019, it was up 2.4 percent, and\nthe fall 2019 estimate puts us 3.4 percent ahead of\nfall 2018. Two principal causes are evident. First, were graduating\nstudents at increasing and historically high rates (more on this\nin a subsequent update), and this is stabilizing undergraduate enrollment.\nSecond, masters program enrollments are growing significantly. From 2009 to\n2017, an average of 139 masters students enrolled at UW-Parkside.\nIn spring 2019, there were 312. This fall, the number\nhas increased to 467 (and 236 are in the new\nonline MBA)! In the past two years, the percentage of\nour students who are in masters programs has increased from\n3.4 percent to 10.5 percent with additional growth possible. This\ngrowth has shored up our finances and this has permitted\nus to act on the Chancellors Cabinet priority to implement\nan equity increase in salaries that is completely campus-funded. About\nthree-in-four faculty and staff at UW-Parkside received increases based on\nhow their past salaries compared to peer levels (using an\napproach initially developed by the University Committee). The adjustments may\nnot have been large, averaging 1.6 percent, but in combination\nwith recent and upcoming UW System-wide raises, its much needed\nprogress. In addition, the Chancellors Cabinet has set a goal\nof raising the minimum wage on campus to $15/hour, and\nraised it to $14/hour beginning back on July 1. Going\nforward, well continue to refine our equity strategy to better\naddress where the needs are greatest. We do hope to\nleave you with the thought that our ability to pay\ncompetitively is strengthened as we serve more students and serve\nthem well. To do this, we will continue to seek\nways to better support the transformative work you do. Debbie\nFord Chancellor Rob Ducoffe Provost Scott Menke Vice Chancellor Welcome\nto the Fall Semester | September 16, 2019 We have\nofficially launched Strategic Framework 2025 which will guide the vision\nof our university. I encourage you to explore the website\nand gain a better understanding of how we will continue\nto offer a transformative education for our students. It all\nstarts with our ability to educate our students and to\nbe a talent provider for this region and beyond. Some\nof you have heard me say that we have established\na stretch goal to graduate 50% more students by 2025\n which represents 400 more graduates per year. Were well\non our way to reaching that goal with growing enrollment,\nnew undergraduate and graduate academic programs, and successful outreach across\nthe region and beyond. Yes, lets celebrate our accomplishments and\nfocus on how we are positioning UW-Parkside as our learning\ncommunity begins its next 50 years. I am proud of\nall that we have accomplished at UW-Parkside and I know\nbased on our past performance that we will succeed in\nimplementing the UW-Parkside Strategic Framework 2025. We need more focused\nattention on the recruitment and retention of our faculty and\nstaff of color at UW-Parkside; and we need more focused\nengagement on the success of our students of color at\nUW-Parkside. Yes, we are the most diverse campus in the\nUniversity of Wisconsin System; and, yes, we have the highest\ngraduation rate in our history. But a closer look at\nthe data shows that we have significant gaps in student\nachievement for students of color. Diversity is having a seat\nat the table, inclusion is having a voice, and belonging\nis making sure that voice is heard. I invite you\nto consider how you might add your voice, your ideas,\nand your actions as we begin another year of transformative\neducation at UW-Parkside. The time is now. An integrated, equity-focused,\nand outcomes-based approach to improve graduation rates and eliminate achievement\ngaps will guide our work as we continuously improve student\nsuccess. We will focus on increasing access and affordability by\nseeking growth in fellowships, scholarships and financial aid. The knowledge,\nskills, and commitment of our faculty and staff to recruit,\nadvise, teach, engage, support, and ultimately graduate students, forms the\nprocesses we will use to equip our region with educated\nand prepared citizens to keep us moving forward. The voices,\nideas, and actions of each member of the network are\nvital to the overall success in our region. I am\nproud to say that we are active participants because of\nour commitment to the community and because of the expertise\nour faculty, staff, alumni, and students bring to the table.\n& Staff Alumni Donor Media Apply NowVisit CampusRequest InfoVirtual Tour\nUWP Information HLC Accreditation University Police Campus Safety Giving Contact",

The play depicts the struggles\nof the Mexican Revolution and relating the Mexican experience to\nthe struggles of today. Last year the campus hosted a\nprelude of the performance. The production will be making its\ndebut with a showing on Thursday Nov. 2 at 7\np.m. in the Black Box Theatre at UW-Parkside. The second\nperformance will be on Friday Nov. 3 at 7 p.m.\nat the Kenosha Creative Space. Both performances are free and\nopen to the public. The play is made possible by\na grant from the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning\nand Excelencia in Education. The one-man theatrical presentation Carpa Revolution\nchronicles the Mexican Revolution of 1910. The story is told\nthrough the eyes of a Mexican vaudevillian, Mario, during the\nbackdrop of the revolution and the traveling tent shows of\nMexico, known as Las Carpas De Mexico. A great deal\nof the process has been involved in in-depth research, writing,\nand character development to bring the best perspective, breadth, and\nheart of the rebels and civilians during the Mexican Revolution.\nAudience members will engage with the host of characters in\nthis dynamic, emotional, and original live theatre storytelling experience. Gia\nGutierrez, Program Manager and Deans Assistant of the College of\nSocial Sciences and Professional Studies, comments that the project is\na celebration of history, culture and the importance of social\nsciences in present times.

Community\nleaders from both the public and private sectors share this\nbelief. During the past six months, they have taken time\nto contact Gov. Scott Walker's office and the offices of\nour state representatives advocating for the value of UW-Parkside and\nthe UW System. Without the calls, letters, and other statements\nof support, our elected officials may conclude that the people\nthey represent are not interested in affordable, public higher education.\nAs the 2017-2019 state budget process continues, your advocacy for\nUW-Parkside and the UW System is needed and appreciated. We\nare encouraged by Gov. Walker's plan to reinvest in the\nUW System. Overall, we see his budget proposal as an\nindication that he values the UW and its role in\nmoving Wisconsin forward. There are elements, however, that require a\ncloser look. Your leadership team at UW-Parkside and leadership teams\nthroughout the UW System, are carefully reviewing policies tied to\nfunding for public higher education. There are two key areas\nof the state budget that will directly impact UW-Parkside in\nthe near future: funding for infrastructure renewal and facility upgrades\nto Wyllie Hall; and funding to support competitive compensation for\nour dedicated faculty and staff. The UW System capital budget\nrequest addresses infrastructure needs in Wyllie Hall that were identified\nas a priority for the 2015-2017 biennium, but were not\nfunded in the final state budget. The governor's proposed capital\nbudget for 2017-2019 defers the Wyllie Hall project, yet again.\nThe cost of the project has already increased by more\nthan 10 percent. Deferring the work beyond 2019 will undoubtedly\ndrive the cost even higher. There is also concern that\npostponing infrastructure and maintenance upgrades may result in more costly\nemergency repairs. Another issue is competitive compensation for UW-Parkside faculty\nand staff. By including funds to address compensation, Gov. Walker\nrecognizes that our dedicated faculty and staff are key to\nthe success of our students and the economic vitality of\nour region. It is important to recognize that, on average,\ncompensation for UW-Parkside faculty and staff trails our peer institutions\nby almost 20 percent. We encourage the Wisconsin Legislature to\nprovide funding for compensation as requested by the Board of\nRegents. UW-Parkside faculty and staff are responsible stewards of financial\nand human resources. Today, close to 40 percent of the\nstudents from southeastern Wisconsin who attend a UW institution attend\nUW-Parkside. During the past six years, more people have earned\ndegrees at UW-Parkside than during any other six-year period in\nour history  and the majority of them were the\nfirst in their families to earn a degree. Wisconsin Department\nof Workforce Development data indicates that the state's economy will\nrequire more than 21,000 people each year for the next\nfive years with associate, bachelor's, master's, doctorate or professional degrees.\nFor jobs requiring a bachelor's degree, the total average job\nopenings are projected at more than 13,000 each year. UW-Parkside\nis developing ready talent for southeastern Wisconsin, the fastest growing\nregion in our state. Investment by the State of Wisconsin\nin UW-Parkside and the UW System is ultimately an investment\nin the people we will need to move Wisconsin forward.\nIf you believe that affordable, accessible, public higher education is\na priority for our region and our state, please call\nor write your state representatives and tell them so.

Courses\nTransferring PACC Courses Scholarship Other College Credit Programs Teacher Education\nProgram FAQ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS What is Credit Utility? Credit\nutility refers to how course/credits count towards a degree, major,\nminor, or certificate. There should be a purpose for taking\nthe college course beyond just earning college credits, students should\nknow ahead of time if that course will transfer to\ntheir chosen postsecondary institution and what exactly it will count\nfor. To the best of our ability, the PACC program\nwill help you determine if the course is appropriate for\nyou to take while in high school. Do I have\nto go to UW-Parkside to take a PACC course? All\nPACC courses are taught at your high school during the\nregular school day and are scheduled just like your other\ncourses. You will have to complete the PACC program admission\nand enrollment process, which is similar to the process for\nstudents who do attend classes on our campus, but we\nwill walk you through all of that. How can my\nhigh school teacher also teach college courses? All PACC courses\nare taught by qualified high school faculty who have gone\nthrough the same credential verification as UW-Parkside faculty, and are\napproved to teach UW-Parkside college courses by the content department\nfaculty. In addition, every high school faculty member in the\nPACC program continuously works with a UW-Parkside faculty liaison, who\nyou may see in your classes. More than likely you\nwill already know the high school faculty teaching the PACC\ncourse.

Despite lower unemployment rates in\nrecent years as well as new employers moving into the\nregion, challenges in the labor market remain. In particular, women\nearn less than men overall. The data show differences along\nbroad categories in employment and labor force participation. These data\nserve as a starting point about womens participation in the\nworkforce across different sectors as well as the need for\nequitable compensation between men and women.

Hispanic women in\nKenosha and Racine had slightly higher LFP rates than Hispanic\nwomen in the state, +3.6% points in Kenosha, and +1.3%\npoints in Racine. The LFP rate for black women in\nRacine was substantially lower (-5.8% points) than black women in\nWisconsin. With the exception of the black population, men have\nhigher LFP rates than women. Hispanic women in Kenosha recorded\nthe largest gender disparity in LFP rates; Hispanic women had\na LFP rate 12.1% points lower than Hispanic men. Black\nwomen in the state (+6.4% points) and in Racine (+6.1%\npoints) recorded LFP rate higher than men. Data Source 2013-2017\nAmerican Community Survey 5-year Estimates: Tables S2301 (all); C23002H (White\nalone, not Hispanic); C23002I (Hispanic); and C23002B (Black alone). *Labor\nforce participation rate = (unemployed + employed) / (civilian noninstitutional\npopulation, age 16) Total White Hispanic Black Data Interpretation With\nthe exception of Hispanic women, employment rates were lower for\nwomen in the counties than more generally in the state\nof Wisconsin. This is especially true for black women, where\ncompared to Wisconsin, the female employment rate was 5.7% points\nlower in Kenosha, and 3.3% points lower in Racine. In\ncontrast, Hispanic women in the counties had slightly higher employment\nrates than the state, +0.6% points in Kenosha, and +2.8%\npoints in Racine. With the exception of black in Wisconsin\nand in Racine County, women had lower employment rates than\nmen. This was especially true for Hispanic women in Kenosha,\nwho registered an employment rate that was 11.3% points lower\nthan Hispanic men. As we saw with the labor force\nparticipation rate, the gender gap among blacks in Wisconsin and\nRacine proved to be an exception. In Wisconsin, the employment\nrate for black women was 10% points higher than black\nmen. Data Source 2013-2017 American Community Survey 5-year Estimates: Tables\nS2301 (all); C23002H (White alone, not Hispanic); C23002I (Hispanic); and\nC23002B (Black alone). * Employment rate = (employed) / (civilian\nnoninstitutional population, age 16) Total White Hispanic Black Data Interpretation\nWithin each race/ethnicity group, rates of unemployment among Kenosha women\nwere higher than observed statewide, with Hispanic and black women\nin Kenosha recording unemployment rates 4.0% points and 7.2% points\nhigher than respective rates in the state. In contrast, Hispanic\nand black women in Racine registered lower levels of unemployment\nthan their counterparts statewide, -2.5% points and -3.1% points, respectively.\nIn Kenosha, women experienced practically the same rate of unemployment\nas men overall. However, black women in Kenosha had an\nunemployment rate 2.6% points higher than black men in the\ncounty. This is in stark contrast with black women at\nthe state level who had an unemployment rate 3.1% points\nlower than black men statewide. In Racine, women recorded lower\nunemployment rates than men across all groups, with black women\nregistering an unemployment rate that was 8.7% points lower than\nblack men in Racine. Data Source 2013-2017 American Community Survey\n5-year Estimates: Tables S2301 (all); C23002H (White alone, not Hispanic);\nC23002I (Hispanic); and C23002B (Black alone). * Unemployment rate =\n(unemployed) / (unemployed + employed) Occupational Distribution Data Interpretation A\nsalient feature of the U.S. labor market is the separation\nof men and women into occupations dominated by one or\nthe other gender. Tracking occupational segregation is important for a\nnumber of reasons, but it is particularly critical in understanding\nthe gender earnings gap. The dissimilarity index (DI)[i] is a\nway of measuring how much gender segregation there is among\nthe 25 occupations reported in the American Community Survey. DI\nranges from 100, perfect segregation into strictly womens jobs and\nmens jobs, to 0, or perfect occupational integration where each\noccupation contains the same percentage female as the overall workforce.\nAs the table shows, in 2017 there was more occupational\nsegregation in Wisconsin and the two counties than observed in\nthe U.S. The DI=39.7 for the entire U.S. means that\nnearly 40% of women employed in the U.S. would have\nto change jobs in order to attain perfect occupational integration.\nThe State of Wisconsin and Racine County had similar levels\nof occupational segregation (42.9 and 43.0), where about 43% of\nwomen would have to change jobs to achieve perfect integration.\nKenosha exhibited the highest level of segregation, requiring nearly 44%\nof women to change jobs to attain integration. [i] DI=\nwhere fi (mi) is the number of females (males) in\nthe ith occupation, and F (M) is the total number\nof females (males) employed in the geographic area. Data Source\n2013-2017 ACS 5-year Estimates Table S2402 The dissimilarity index (DI)[i]\nis a way of measuring how much gender segregation there\nis among the 25 occupations reported in the American Community\nSurvey. Total White Hispanic Black Data Interpretation The figures reported\nin these charts reflect the percentage of all women (men)\nin each geographic area employed in a broad occupational category.\nFor example, 45.5% (34.8%) of all women (men) in Wisconsin\nwere employed in management, professional, and related occupations.[i] In all\nrace/ethnicity groups, the percentage of women in management, professional, and\nrelated occupations (MPR) is larger than the percentage of men\nin those occupations. While the percentages were smaller for both\ngenders, the gender disparity is strongest among Hispanic and black\nwomen. For example, in Racine about 20% of black women\nand less than 10% of black men held MPR jobs.\nThere is a much larger percentage of white women in\nthe MPR jobs than among Hispanic and black women. For\nexample, in Racine about 39% of white women had MPR\noccupations, but only 20% of Racine Hispanic women had MPR\njobs. [i] The three broad occupational categories have the following\ndefinitions: Management, Professional, and Related includes: management; business and financial\noperations; computer and mathematical; architecture and engineering; life, physical, and\nsocial science; community and social services; legal; education, training, and\nlibrary; arts, design, entertainment, sports, and media occupations. Sales and\nOffice includes: sales and related; office and administrative support occupations\nService includes: healthcare support occupations; fire-fighting and prevention, and other\nprotective service workers including supervisors; law enforcement workers including supervisors;\nfood preparation and serving related; building and grounds cleaning and\nmaintenance; personal care and service occupations. The two excluded occupational\ncategories are natural resources, construction, and maintenance, and production, transportation,\nand material moving which combined accounted for 10% of female\nworkers in Wisconsin. Data Source 2013-2017 ACS 5-year Estimates, Tables\nS2402, C24010A, C24010I, and C24010B. Total White Hispanic Black Data\nInterpretation With the exception of blacks in Racine, there is\na significantly larger share of women in sales and office\noccupations than men. For example, in Racine 35% of White\nwomen but only 14% of white men were working in\nsales and office occupations. In Racine, however, the share of\nblack women in sales and office jobs (17.9%) is only\nmarginally higher than the share of black men in those\noccupations (15.6%). Data Source 2013-2017 ACS 5-year Estimates, Tables S2402,\nC24010A, C24010I, and C24010B. Total White Hispanic Black Data Interpretation\nThere is a larger share of women in service occupations\nthan men in all groups. In Racine, 49% of black\nwomen but only 22.5% of black men had service jobs.\nThe share of both men and women in service occupations\nwas larger among Hispanics and blacks than among whites. Data\nSource 2013-2017 ACS 5-year Estimates, Tables S2402, C24010A, C24010I, and\nC24010B. Earnings Gender Gap Total White Hispanic Black Data Interpretation\nIn 2017, the overall earnings gender gap of 21% points\nin the State of Wisconsin was 1% point higher than\nthe national earnings gender gap. The gap in both counties\nwas slightly larger, 22% points in Kenosha and 23% points\nin Racine. For all women, the reason for the larger\ngender gap in the counties was that men in the\ncounties earned more than men statewide, while women in the\ncounties earned about the same as women statewide. The earnings\ngender gap among Hispanics in the state and in Racine\nwere relatively small (10% points) but in Kenosha it was\n27% points. The reason for the large gender gap among\nHispanics in Kenosha is that Hispanic women earned substantially less\nthan Hispanic women statewide, while Hispanic men in Kenosha earned\nabout the same as their counterparts statewide. In Kenosha, black\nwomen achieved near earnings parity and recorded only a 4.3%\npoint gender gap, while in Racine black women recorded a\n22% point gap. The reason for near-parity in Kenosha, however,\nwas not because womens earnings were relatively high, rather it\nwas because the annual earnings of black men in Kenosha\nwas about $2,000 less than their counterparts statewide. In Racine,\nthe story was reversed  black women earned nearly $4,000\nless than their counterparts statewide, while the annual earnings of\nblack men in Racine was the same as earnings of\nblack men statewide.

When you see people\nengaged in their passion you no longer see how they\nare different from you. You see a way to connect.\nsaid Wagner, photographer and creator of THE PASSIONS MOVEMENT. Throughout\nthe process of photographing Racine residents, Wagner has become woven\ninto a tapestry of stories and experiences which are shared\nin the exhibit. She recalls, I was a queer kid\ngrowing up here. Ive left and returned, and have lived\nthe change that has happened. To see this work being\nsupported and embraced feels like coming full circle. There is\nmore work to be done, but it is amazing to\nme that this is happening here, now. Wagner has partnered\nwith the United Way of Racine County and the Racine\nArts Council to capture the stories and passions of local\nmultigenerational queer persons through the art-based, community-impact photo installation.

While attending Parkside, she entered the laboratory of\nDr. Carmel Ruffolo, studying the causative agent of fowl cholera,\nPasteurella multocida, for completion of her undergraduate thesis research. That\nexperience is what solidified her interest in bacterial pathogenesis and\nprepared her for the next stage in her scientific training\nas a Ph.D. candidate in the laboratory of Dr. B.\nBrett Finlay at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver,\nBC, Canada. Dr. Dobsons doctoral research focused mainly on tissue\nmicrobiology, specifically on the characterization of Salmonella typhimurium infection of\nthe gallbladder during an acute, murine model of typhoid fever.\nDuring her doctoral training, Dr. Dobson was first introduced to\nimaging, where she carried out mainly wide-field microscopy, as well\nas a small amount of electron microscopy. As a result\nof this exposure, a genuine interest was formed. For the\nnext step in her scientific training, she therefore aimed to\ncontinue studies of the hosts response to invading pathogens during\nher postdoctoral work. However, she also wanted to expand her\nexperience in optical microscopy, choosing a research environment that would\nallow her to regularly apply advanced imaging techniques. Dr. Dobson\nfound exactly that within the laboratory of Philippe Sansonetti at\nthe Institut Pasteur in Paris, France. During the first years\nof her postdoctoral training within the Sansonetti laboratory, Dr. Dobsons\ninterest and training in microscopy grew considerably. She was not\nonly applying multiple imaging modalities and basic analysis methods within\nher own research, but she also attended various courses and\nconferences to better improve her knowledge, as she continually sought\nmore extensive training outside the biological confines of her own\nlaboratory. Dr. Dobson also shifted her research focus within the\nSansonetti laboratory towards projects where she could put her new\nskills to full use, projects whose primary focus was the\napplication of imaging and analysis methodologies. As time went on,\nDr. Dobson became more driven by the desire to develop\nand apply new technologies to better understand dynamic biological phenomena\nrather than limiting herself to the pursuit of a single\nbiological question. As a result, she found herself drawn towards\nan environment that engages in software development within a biological\ncontext, directly linking imaging to biology. The laboratory of Dr.\nKevin Eliceiri, the Laboratory of Optical and Computational Instrumentation (LOCI),\nat the University of Wisconsin - Madison provided exactly such\nan environment. Dr. Dobson carried out a second postdoc with\nDr. Eliceiri training in software development of the open source\nsoftware ImageJ, integrating improved statistical algorithms within those computational tools\nthat could be applied directly towards quantitative image analysis within\nrelevant biological models. She now works as an Assistant Scientist\nat LOCI, and her main role is in training new\nImageJ users, assisting them with their image analysis workflows, as\nwell as running regular training workshops and outreach activities. Dr.\nDobson is truly passionate about the interdisciplinary field of microscopy\nand bioimaging, which for her represents the perfect balance of\nscience, collaboration, and innovation. Dr. Dobson is also very passionate\nabout the field of Career Development, working closely with the\nUW-Madison Office of Postdoctoral Studies and the Morgridge Institute for\nResearch in designing and delivering career development programming for postdoctoral\nresearchers and staff scientists on campus. Therefore, her drive is\nnot solely on the study of science, but on how\nto best work with other scientists to help them reach\ntheir full potential in their own careers as well. Ultimately,\nDr. Dobsons goal is to aid scientists in their own\nresearch and career pursuits, as well as advocating for them\nto the broader community. Dr. Dobson and her husband, Justin,\nare expecting their first child in January 2021. They reside\nin the lovely city of Madison, WI, where they enjoy\nhiking, cooking, traveling, and tasting great Wisconsin beer.

When we submitted our proposed annual\nbudget in May, prior to knowing the final outcome of\nthe state's 2015-2017 biennial budget, we had already reduced our\nbase budget by approximately $2 million to address a well-documented\nstructural deficit. Our 2014-2015 operating budget was $90.5 million. As\nI have communicated in the past, much of that reduction\nwas accomplished through the elimination of 14 vacant staff positions.\nWhen Gov. Walker signed the 2015-2017 state budget on July\n12, that action set in motion a $250-million reduction in\nfunding to the UW System and a tuition freeze for\nresident undergraduates through the 2016-2017 academic year. Our portion of\nthe $250-million cut is a reduction to our base budget\nof $1.5 million in each of the next two years.\nHowever, this amount is approximately $2 million a year less\nthan what we may have incurred under previous budget-reduction allocations.\nIn addition, UW System is investing $1.7 million in one-time\nfunds to help us enhance our learning environment as we\nwork together to grow enrollment and sustain historic levels of\nstudent success. Without question, your compassion, advocacy, and support \nalong with that of our community partners, our students, their\nfamilies and our alumni  helped secure additional resources. Read\nmore about the 2015-2017 state budget and its impact on\nthe UW System. Statute vs. Policy In addition, the 2015-2017\nbiennial budget includes statutory changes to Chapter 36 of the\nWisconsin Administrative Code. Tenure provisions were removed from state statutes\nand adopted into UW Board of Regents policy. UW System\nPresident Ray Cross and Board of Regents President Regina Millner\nhave appointed a task force to review the tenure policy.\nProfessor of Communication Dr. Jonathan Shailor will represent UW-Parkside on\nthis important initiative, which begins in August. I will work\nclosely with Dr. Shailor and faculty leaders to keep the\ncampus informed of the group's progress. Several changes also were\nmade to the shared governance language contained in Wisconsin statutes.\nYou can read the details of the changes here. A\nfew weeks ago, I met with leaders from the faculty,\nacademic staff, and university staff to discuss the anticipated changes\nin shared-governance language. We agreed that the principles of shared\ngovernance are core to our work and shared mission at\nUW-Parkside. We agreed to maintain normal operations as we work\ntogether to understand the new language and review our policies,\npractices and procedures. To paraphrase Secretary of the Faculty Dr.\nGreg Mayer, I ask the campus governance groups and committees\nto \"consider how their operations and responsibilities will be maintained,\ntransformed, transferred, or retired (as the case may be) under\nthe requirements and implications of the new statutory language, and\nto bring these considerations as to how their roles may\nchange to our forthcoming discussions.\" The shared governance task force\nappointed by President Cross and Regent President Millner has been\nrelieved of its duties since the shared governance language, although\naltered, remains in state statutes. Challenges vs. Opportunities The 2015-2017\nstate budget creates both challenges and opportunities for UW-Parkside. During\n2015-16, we will continue to be excellent stewards of our\nfinancial resources using a three-part strategy to address funding challenges:\nmaintain a strong focus on enrollment growth by making strategic\ninvestments in new program development and innovations, especially those that\nsupport and serve our adult learners; reduce expenses where possible;\nand use one-time funds from UW System and from our\nlimited balances to bridge gaps in funding. The path to\nfiscal stability and growth is a united and strategic focus\non student success. I am confident we will continue to\nprovide a quality learning experience for our students inside and\noutside of the classroom. In an environment that is always\nchanging, the one constant has been your commitment to delivering\nour mission and being a champion of all that makes\nUW-Parkside a real and amazing place to learn and grow.\nJoin with me as we enhance our efforts to recruit,\nenroll, retain, support, inspire, teach, learn from, and graduate UW-Parkside\nstudents. In a little less than a month  Thursday,\nAug. 27, to be exact  we'll gather for our\nannual Fall Convocation to celebrate and honor faculty and staff,\nwelcome new colleagues, and recognize our retirees. Together, we will\nadvance access to quality and relevant higher education through the\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Parkside. The future of our students and the\nvitality of our region depend on it.

Faculty Work Lisa Marie\nBarber Professor Ceramics, Foundations Email | Personal Web Site |\nFaculty Profile View work \"The majority of my ceramic work,\noften formatted as figures within dense environments, portrays how I\nwish to understand people in the world. I strive to\ncreate worlds composed of multiple, individualized parts, meant to be\ncelebratory, shrine-like collections. Within them, the human is presented as\na passive being, aware of life's weight, yet confident in\nits value. Often, the figures are children. Chosen for their\npurity of being, I use children as models of simplistic,\nunalienated living. To me, they represent a connection to the\nworld that can be simultaneously awkward and full of possibility.\nIn addition to these large-scale sculptures and installations, I also\ncreate series of paintings, drawings, and mixed-media works in the\nforms of quilts and assemblage sculpture. These works explore similar\nthemes, as well as divergent subject matter.\" Tom Berenz Chair\n& Assistant Professor Painting, Foundations Email | Personal Site |\nFaculty Profile View Work \"My paintings are about my relationship\nto the world around me; cerebral and physical, intellectual and\nvisceral. I use the disaster motif as a metaphor to\ndiscuss personal, sociopolitical, environmental and ideological issues. Through the motif\nof disaster, I explore the existential self and examine personal\nnarratives, with some being more literal and others more enigmatic.\nNotions of loss, place, memory, space and time are central\nas I reexamine personal experiences from my past and present.\nThe imagery is in constant flux, but always returns to\na pile. A pile is everything and it is nothing.\nIt is a mound that once was and now isn't;\na mass of information, both physical and metaphysical, organized and\nchaotic. I am interested in blurring the lines between realism\nand abstraction, life and death, beauty and horror, devastation and\nsublime. Everything we live with as Americans is delicately balanced-the\ncars (magic carpets/ death traps), houses (castles/ prisons), and wilderness\n(paradise/oblivion).\" Judi Golombowski Lecturer Introduction to Digital Art Email |\nFaculty Profile View Work Judith received her Masters of fine\narts with honors from the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee. She\nhas been creating visual works of art based on her\nobservations of her world as long as she can remember.Her\ninspirations vary from nature, to structures, to abstract ideas from\nher past and present and recently old portrait photos. She\nbelieves her most valued ability is to learn from her\nworld around her and to share what she has learned.\nShe is a teacher, an academic of creative and conceptual\nproblem solving for the visual arts. Daniel \"Dan\" Martin Assistant\nProfessor Graphic Design Email | Personal Website | Faculty Profile\n\"I am a designer because I enjoy solving problems; I\nchose graphic design specifically because the problems are visual and\ncommunicative problems, not purely aesthetic but not purely utilitarian. Graphic\ndesign extends into many forms of media, from traditional print\nto screens, web sites, motion graphics, apparel, packaging, books, fabricated\nworks, and photography; I relish opportunities to apply my practice\nto a variety of media. Research, planning, and organization are\nvery important to my work; I view the design process\nas a cognitive act regardless of medium. Currently, I am\nmost interested by graphic design in and around digital humanities,\nacademic publishing, data visualization, antiracism, and social justice.\" William \"Doug\"\nSingsen Assistant Professor Art History Email | Faculty Profile View\nArticles \"My research right now focuses primarily on the interaction\nbetween the avant-garde and popular culture. My dissertation, which was\ncompleted in 2013 and was entitled \"An Alternative by Any\nOther Name: Alternative Comics between the 'Mainstream' and the Avant-Garde,\n1976 to the Present,\" examined the history of \"alternative comics,\"\na category roughly comparable to alternative film or music, which\ncombined influences from mainstream superhero, horror and crime comics, the\ncountercultural underground comics of the late sixties and early seventies,\nand other avant-garde traditions. In 2014, a revised chapter from\nmy dissertation was published in the Journal of Graphic Novels\nand Comics, and I have plans to publish other chapters\nfrom it in the future. My dissertation also raised broader\nquestions about the history of interactions between the avant-garde and\npopular culture. I wanted to put alternative comics in a\nbroader historical perspective but was confronted by the fact that\nthere are very few studies of this area, and those\nthat do exist are generally focused on one medium, time\nperiod, or society. I therefore began studying both the history\nof interactions between the avant-garde and popular culture and the\ntheoretical models that have been applied to them, and I\nhope to begin publishing work on these topics in 2015.\"\nCarey Watters Associate Professor Graphic Design Email | Personal Web\nSite | Faculty Profile View Work \"A found object can\nbe a mysterious thing. Inherent in every object is a\nnarrative that describes the object itself or the life of\nthe owner. The reality of an object's function is defined\nby the original owner. Every found object has a story\nto tell, a story I try to uncover. In my\nwork, the found object is reinvented, and a new narrative\nis discovered through the manipulation of structure. By investigating sequential\ndesign and book structures I create a new way of\nengaging with an object. A new identity emerges. The users'\ninteraction with the object creates a new history. The lines\nof function and design are blurred, and as the object\nis manipulated a new definition appears.\" Apply NowVisit CampusRequest InfoVirtual\nPartners UWP Information HLC Accreditation University Police Campus Safety Giving\nContact Us Calendar Apply Site Map Future Students Applicants Admitted\nStudents Current Students Faculty & Staff Student, Faculty & Staff",
