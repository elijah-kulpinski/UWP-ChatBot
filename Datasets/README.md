# Dataset Folder

## Overview
This folder contains all the data utilized for training our Language Learning Model (LLM). It includes several important subfolders and files:

### Run 1 Folder
This is our initial attempt at dataset creation for training purposes. The contents of this folder are:
- **Full Dataset:** The complete set of data collected and used.
- **Flagged Prompts:** Contains duplicates within the dataset that need attention.
- **Augmented Data:** Enhanced datasets using the techniques described in the data augmenting script located in the Important Scripts folder.

## Future Work: Clustering Enhancements
Moving forward, the use of clustering techniques could significantly enhance the structure and utility of this dataset. Here are some suggestions for future improvements:

### Using Clustering to Improve Dataset Quality
- **Implement Advanced NLP Techniques:** Apply more sophisticated Natural Language Processing techniques to better preprocess and prepare data for clustering.
- **Optimize k-Means Clustering:** Enhance the k-means clustering algorithm to more effectively categorize the data based on textual similarities. This could involve tuning parameters, using dimensionality reduction techniques, or exploring different distance metrics.
- **Evaluate and Iterate:** Regularly evaluate the clustering output to identify areas for improvement in both the data preprocessing steps and the clustering algorithm itself.

These enhancements will aim to increase the effectiveness and accuracy of the data categorization, thereby improving the overall quality of the datasets used for training our models.
