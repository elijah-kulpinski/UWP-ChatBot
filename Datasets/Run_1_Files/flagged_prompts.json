If all sections of a course use the\nsame assignments, a single syllabus may be submitted for all\nsections. If different assignments are used in different sections, a\nseparate syllabus must be submitted for each section. The learning\ngoals for every General Education course and the assignments that\nachieve these goals must be listed in a General Education\nstatement in the syllabus. A checklist of course requirements, including\na sample syllabus statement, is provided below. COMMUNICATION LITERACY General\nEducation Minimum Course Expectations Communication | Literacy Literacy | Reading\nand writing for understanding and effective communication At the 100-level,\ninstructors may opt to emphasize reading within a discipline over\nwriting. Assignments should be constructed so that feedback occurs at\nleast 6 times throughout the semester. At the 200-level, instructors\nare expected to include both reading and writing components. Assignments\nshould be constructed so that feedback occurs at least 4\ntimes throughout the semester. Criteria addressed should be identified on\nthe syllabus. READING EXPECTATIONS Requirement. For traditional first-year students, new\nto the discipline/topic, the time spent per week should be\napproximately two hours per credit-hour. Therefore for a 3-credit class,\nstudents are expected to complete 6-hours of reading. In some\ndisciplines that might be equivalent to 100-pages per week, in\nothers 30-40. Evidence of the requirement should be measured by\na minimum of two of the following: 1. Comprehends vocabulary\nappropriately to summarize or paraphrase the information. 2. Applies knowledge\nto a variety of reading assignments. 3. Identifies aspects of\na text to respond to questions posed in assigned tasks.\n4. Comments on texts in ways that preserve the authors\nmeanings and link them to the assignment. WRITING EXPECTATIONS Requirement.\nStudents should write a minimum the equivalent of 12-16 pages\ntyped, doublespaced, normal 12-point font (such as Times or Times\nNew Roman). Examples of some ways in which a course\nmight meet this minimum: 1. Four 3-4-page papers 2. Six\n2-page papers 3. Fourteen 1-page papers 4. Two essay exams\nand five papers (sufficient to achieve the minimum equivalent) 5.\nWeekly in-class writing assignments which are revised and collected into\na portfolio. These are only examples; instructors are free to\ndesign their own \"road\" to the minimum amount of writing\nin keeping with best practices of the individual disciplines. Evidence\nof writing quality should be based on control of syntax\nand mechanics plus a minimum of two of the following:\n1. Demonstrates attention to context, audience, purpose, and to the\nassigned task(s) 2. Uses appropriate content to develop ideas 3.\nConsistency of organization and presentation 4. Use of sources to\nsupport ideas in writing Approved by the UW-Parkside Faculty Senate\non May 7, 2013. Oral Communication Oral Communication | Listening,\nSpeaking, and Presenting Effectively The AAC&U defines oral communication as:\nprepared, purposeful presentation designed to increase knowledge, to foster understanding,\nor to promote change in the listeners' attitudes, values, beliefs,\nor behaviors. At the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, oral communication is\nrecognized as consisting of three components: listening, speaking, and presenting\neffectively. Courses addressing oral communication must include all three components.\nLISTENING Listening is a specific communication skill that is separate\nalbeit interconnected with effective presentation. According to the National Communication\nAssociation, Listening is the process of receiving, constructing meaning from,\nand responding to spoken and/or nonverbal messages. People listen in\norder to comprehend information, critique and evaluate a message, show\nempathy for the feelings expressed by others, or appreciate a\nperformance. Effective listening includes both literal and critical comprehension of\nideas and information transmitted in oral language. (pp. 10-11)1 Students\nshould be explicitly assessed on their listening skills, and there\nshould be documentation provided of the students comprehension, critique, or\naesthetic appreciation through listening. Students should apply criteria while listening\nthat is appropriate for the subject matter of the course\ndisciplinary background. Evidence of effective listening should be documented through\na product such as written assignment, orally-presented assignment, or examination\nperformance. Effective listening should be evaluated by some of the\nfollowing specific criteria:2 Recognition of main ideas Identify supporting details\nRecognize explicit relationships among ideas Recall basic ideas and details\nAttend with an open mind Perceive the speakers or performance\npurpose and organization of ideas and information Discriminate between statements\nof fact and statements of opinion Distinguish between emotional and\nlogical arguments Detect bias and prejudice o Recognize speakers attitude\nSynthesize and evaluate by drawing logical inferences and conclusions Recall\nthe implications and arguments Recognize discrepancies between the speakers verbal\nand non-verbal messages Employ active listening techniques when appropriate Apply\nappropriate aesthetic criteria when assessing an artistic performance SPEAKING Speaking\nout loud in a formal situation can be a stressful\nand difficult and it combines a number of skills. Students\nshould be encouraged to think about the speaking part of\na presentation as separate from the content. The ways in\nwhich one presents the content are a specific communication skill.\nSpeaking is about communicating effectively through volume, enunciation, pace, rhythm,\nand pitch. An effective presentation will involve clear and effective\nspeaking to communicate those ideas. Speaking should be evaluated based\non some of the following criteria: Rate  is the\nspeaker taking time and emphasizing important ideas? Volume  can\nthe speaker be heard? Enunciation  can the speaker be\nunderstood? Rhythm  is there variation in the presentation of\nideas, heightening the most important and allowing for pauses where\nlisteners can absorb important points? Pitch  Is the speaker\nusing a pitch range that is pleasant to listen to\nas opposed to being strident or monotone? While speaking is\nonly one facet of oral communication, speakers should be aware\nof the very basic mechanisms of good speaking in order\nto make their presentations as effective as possible. PRESENTING EFFECTIVELY\nMinimum of 2 oral presentations Presentations in total should be\nfor a minimum of 10 minutes (these could be distributed\nin various ways such as a 3-minute and 7-minute presentation,\ntwo 5-minute presentations, a 2-minute, 2-minute, and 6-minute presentation). Only\npresentations that are 2-minutes in length or longer will count\ntoward fulfilling this criterion. Should be based on research or\nmaterial appropriate for specific disciplinary nature of course Should utilize\nan organizational structure appropriate for the disciplinary background(s) of the\ncourse subject material (i.e., problem solution, story/narrative, sequential/chronological) Should be\ndelivered extemporaneously or with minimal use of script or notes\nShould use nonverbal communication to project confidence and establish a\nconnection with the audience by maintaining eye contact with the\naudience and good posture In cases of group presentations, part\nof the students grade should be based on his/her individual\nperformance during the group presentation Present ethically by using language\nthat is respectful of diverse groups and giving proper attribution\nto source material 1http://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/Teaching_and_Learning/Assessment_Resources/PDFSpeaking_and_Listening_Competencies_for_College_Students.pdf 2 Most of these criteria are\ndrawn from the National Communication Associations report on Speaking and\nListening Competencies for College Students. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Information Technology Competence\nCurrent Description | Using modern information technology to retrieve and\ntransmit information Proposed Description | Using modern technology to enhance\ncommunications. This description includes understanding the environment and vocabulary of\nthe technology and any related software. AREAS INCLUDE Functional expertise:\nExpertise in using a computer software tool to enhance communications,\nincluding basic and advanced features of the tool and common\nusage of the tool. Software tools may include, but are\nnot limited to presentation, publishing, spreadsheet, database, web development, graphics,\nartistic software, and at the 100 level, D2L proficiency. Capabilities\nshall include basic and advanced (or beyond basic) abilities. The\nstudent may demonstrate proficiency in one (or more) tools. Computer\nSavvy: Assesses comprehension of the language of computing and its\nintegration into an environment; for example, identifying how computing fits\ninto an organizations operations and/or society; or uses the appropriate\nvocabulary when describing the use of technology to achieve the\ndesired product. Use of English: Appropriate use of English in\nthe final product(s) is expected. A course shall address at\nleast two of these areas. These skills should be assessed\nin at least three assignments, so that techniques may be\npracticed and improved upon. SUGGESTED AREAS FOR ASSESSMENT (Skills such\nas programming, algorithms, and computer system configuration may be assessed\nas part of Reasoned Judgment versus Communication.) Assessment 100-level 200-level\nFunctional Expertise Technical ability in expression: Basic and Advanced features\nBasic features or capabilities 3-5 advanced features or capabilities Computer\nSavvy Technical comprehension Knowledge and usage-level Comprehension, application and/or analysis\nlevels Use of English Functional area: Appropriate application Format, organization,\nappearance, spelling 100-level plus: grammar, style, delivery Creative Expression Creative\nExpression Current Description: Communicating through artistic statement. Proposed Description: Communicating\nthrough or about artistic statement. At all levels: Students will\nexperience and also demonstrate that they understand the centrality of\n'creative expression' to the discipline and art that forms the\nbasis for the coursework as defined by the instructor. At\nthe 100-level, the course should have at least three of\nthe 100-level expectations. At the 200- level, the course should\nincorporate at least two of the 100-level expectations and at\nleast two of the 200-level expectations. These skills should be\nassessed in at least three assignments, so that techniques may\nbe practiced and improved upon. AT THE 100 LEVEL Students\nwill develop, practice, and apply creative expression through original communication\nskills1 in writing, visual art, and/or performing arts, using a\ncommon vocabulary. Students who are creating new artistic works will\nexperience the responsibility of contributing original, sometimes subjective material, open\nfor public and professional critique for which they may be\nasked to defend or explain. Students will critically reflect on\nexperiences in and/or with performance, exhibition, or publication situations. Students\nwill demonstrate understanding of the importance of critique to the\ncreative process. Students will articulate the value of creative expression\nfor individuals, communities, and/or humanity as a whole. AT THE\n200 LEVEL Students will share their work through exhibition, publication,\nand/or performance. Students will apply the fine arts as a\nmeans to understand diversity and the experiences of those who\nare different from oneself. Students will examine creative works both\nstructurally and within larger contexts. 1 This expectation applies to\nstudents communicating through drawing, writing, painting, sculpting, or other original\nexpressions as required by a particular discipline. REASONED JUDGMENT CRITICAL\nTHINKING Critical Thinking Critical Thinking | Applying logic and reasoning\nto problems solving Critical thinking is a habit of mind\ncharacterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and\nevents before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion. There\nare four major components of Critical Thinking: Exploration: Students will\narticulate an issue by explaining ambiguity and identifying boundaries of\nthe issue and relevant context. Evidence: Students will interpret and\nevaluate information from relevant and reliable sources. Influence of points\nof view: Students will identify their own and others point\nof view when presenting a position on an issue. Conclusions:\nStudents will make conclusions which acknowledge complexity. These skills should\nbe assessed in at least two assignments, so that techniques\nmay be practiced and improved upon. AT THE 100-LEVEL Students\nwill fully state, describe, and clarify an issue or problem.\nStudents will analyze and interpret information from at least two\nrelevant and reliable sources. Students will identify their own and\nothers assumptions when presenting a position on an issue. Students\nwill make conclusions that are tied to a range of\ninformation. AT THE 200-LEVEL Students will fully and concisely state,\ndescribe, and clarify an issue or problem and deliver relevant\ninformation necessary for understanding of the issue or problem. Students\nwill analyze, interpret, and synthesize information from multiple relevant and\nreliable sources. Students will identify their own and others assumptions\nand several relevant contexts when presenting a position on an\nissue. Students will make conclusions that are tied to a\nrange of information, including alternative viewpoints. Ethical Thinking Ethical Thinking\nEthical Thinking | Recognizing and analyzing ethical issues and actions\nAt the 100-level, instructors should address a minimum of 2\nof the learning outcomes. At the 200-level, instructors should address\na minimum of 3 of the learning outcomes from at\nleast two categories. Criteria addressed should be identified on the\nsyllabus. KNOWLEDGE 1. Describes their own core beliefs and articulate\nthe origins of these beliefs. 2. Compares and contrasts their\nbeliefs with others objectively in various social contexts. 3. Compares\nand contrasts the consequences/ramifications of actions that have multiple implications.\nSKILLS 1. Applies ethical perspectives/concepts in multiple scenarios. 2. Applies\nethical perspectives/concepts using an alternative perspective in multiple scenarios. 3.\nEvaluates ethical issues from multiple perspectives. Approved by the UW-Parkside\nFaculty Senate on May 7, 2013. SCIENTIFIC THINKING Scientific Thinking\nScientific Thinking | Understanding and applying the scientific method. At\nthe 100-level: Instructors should emphasize at least two expectations from\nthe skills category. At the 200-level: Instructors should emphasize at\nleast two expectations from the skills category and one from\nthe attitudes/behaviors category. Criteria addressed should be identified on the\nsyllabus. KNOWLEDGE (embedded) All general education courses addressing scientific thinking\nare expected to identify relevant content knowledge in terms of\nthe appropriate principles, theories and methods. SKILL Recognizes the application\nof the scientific method in solving contemporary problems. Critically evaluates\ninformation and sources. Converts relevant information into various forms (e.g.\ncharts, graphs, tables, figures). ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS Considers alternate, divergent,\nor contradictory perspectives or ideas. Includes novel or unique approaches\nto problems or ideas. Supporting Information | The criteria presented\nabove were developed through conversations with department chairs/directors in the\nCollege of Natural and Health Sciences, and by using the\nAAC&U Value rubrics for quantitative literacy and creative thinking (www.aacu.org/value/rubrics).\nAnalytical Skills Analytical Skills Analytical skills: Understanding how to produce\nand interpret quantitative and qualitative information. In an effort to\nsustain the emphasis on qualitative and quantitative information and the\ntwo-fold emphasis of interpretation and production of the information, this\nexpectation is framed around three criteria: identification, analysis and conclusion.\nTherefore, the skill cannot be separated from the issue/problem that\nthe information represents. It was our intent to provide a\nframework that would allow instructors to develop course specific outcomes.\nFurthermore, it is important to realize the natural overlap of\nthis outcome with critical thinking and communication. The expectation was\ndeveloped from three AAC&U Value Rubrics Inquiry and Analysis, Problem\nSolving and Quantitative Literacy. Courses at the 100-level are expected\nto address one sub-point under each criterion; courses at the\n200-level are also expected to address all the criteria, but\nshould address at least one additional sub-point under one of\nthe criteria. In an effort to ensure that students receive\nfeedback on developing their analytical skills and to accommodate courses\nwhere the associated assignment is a final, end-of-semester project/report, the\nCommittee requires that students receive feedback at least 3 times\nduring the semester. This will require that instructors focussing on\nan end-of-semester project/report create milestones throughout the semester. Syllabi should\nidentify GE learning goals and outcomes using approved language. For\nthis expectation, syllabi should also identify the relevant sub points,\nbut the outcomes should be stated in the form appropriate\nto the course. Identifying the Issue/Problem  Students construct a\nclear statement of the issue/problem. Sub-points Students can identify evidence\nneeded to examine an issue or problem. Students represent the\nissue/problem in appropriate forms (e.g. charts, graphs, tables, figures, narratives,\netc). Students can convert data/information from one form to another.\nStudents appropriately address the complexity of the issue/problem. Analysis of\nthe Issue/Problem  The analysis indicates the appropriate comprehension of\nthe issue/problem. The analysis is clearly presented and well organized.\nSub-points Design Process - Students incorporate the appropriate elements of\nmethodology/theory in approaching the analysis. This sub-point may also include\naddressing contextual points associated with the problem/issue. Analysis/Calculations - Are\ncorrect and presented appropriately for intended purpose. Conclusion  The\nconclusion is clear, well supported, and logical. Sub points Students\nrecognize the implication and limitations of their analysis. Students identify\nand address assumptions. This may overlap with how the analysis\nis presented. Students recommend, identify, or implement action(s) that address(es)\nthe problem and is supported by the analysis. Students identify\nhow the analysis (information) may be applied to new issues/problems.\nAesthetic Skills Aesthetic Skills Aesthetic skills | Critiquing and appreciating\nthe fine arts At the 100-level | Instructors should address\na minimum total of 3 of the learning outcomes from\nat least two categories. At the 200-level | Instructors should\naddress a minimum total of 4 of the learning outcomes\nfrom at least two categories. Criteria addressed should be identified\non the syllabus, and expectations should be assessed with 3\nor more assignments. APPRECIATION (Affective) Student will: Explain their visceral\nand/or intellectual reaction to artworks in a given media. Contrast\ntheir personal reactions and those of another to one or\nmore artworks on the basis of their formal, material, and\nprocedural elements. Evaluate multiple artworks on the basis of formal,\nmaterial and procedural considerations. Evaluate the quality of an artwork\nin the context of a set of aesthetic criteria. CRITICISM\n(Cognitive) Students will: Describe the formal, material and procedural elements\nin two or more works of art in a given\nmedium, as defined by the instructor. Identify the criteria involved\nin assessing artwork in a given medium and aesthetic criteria\ngenerally. Analyze a work of art or their own personal\nreactions and the reactions of others, in light of aesthetic\ncriteria. Interpret an artwork on the basis of symbolic, historical,\nsocio-political or philosophical considerations. A list of the works consulted\nin preparing this expectation is available upon request. SOCIAL AND\nPERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY Individual Accountability Individual Accountability Individual Accountability | Understanding\nwhat a responsible choice is and that ones present education\nand lifelong learning is a personal responsibility. At the 100-level:\nInstructors should address one expectation from Responsible Choice plus a\nminimum of one other component from each of the remaining\nsections. At the 200-level: Instructors should address one expectation from\nResponsible Choice plus a minimum of three other components using\nboth of the remaining sections. Criteria addressed should be identified\non the syllabus. Responsible choice assumes that all required work\nis completed with evaluation based on the listed components. RESPONSIBLE\nCHOICE Identifies opportunities to expand knowledge, skills, and abilities as\npart of completing required work. Identifies multiple approaches for solving\nthe problem. Approaches may be elementary in scope. Conducts an\nintroductory evaluation of solutions including: history, logic, reasoning, feasibility and\nimpact. Introductory implies that key elements of depth may be\nmissing. Implements the solution in a manner that addresses the\nproblem statement but may ignore relevant contextual factors. CONNECTS TO\nDISCIPLINE AND EXPERIENCE Applies previous knowledge and skills to demonstrate\ncomprehension and performance in novel situations. Compares life experience and\nacademic knowledge to infer differences, as well as similarities, and\nacknowledges perspectives other than own. Uses skills, abilities, theories, or\nmethodologies gained in one situation in a new situation to\ncontribute to understanding of problems or issues. REFLECTION AND SELF-ASSESSMENT\nEvaluates prior learning (past experiences inside and outside of the\nclassroom) with some depth, revealing slightly clarified meanings or indicating\na somewhat broader perspective about educational or life events. Articulates\nstrengths and challenges (within specific performances or events) to increase\neffectiveness in different contexts (through increased self-awareness). Evaluates results relative\nto the problem defined with some consideration of need for\nfurther work. Approved by the UW-Parkside Faculty Senate on May\n7, 2013. SOCIAL JUSTICE Social Justice Current Definition Social Equality\n| Understanding and questioning social, political, economic and historical conditions\nthat construct diversity and inequality Proposed change to Social Justice\nwith the following definition Social Justice | Understanding and questioning\nvalues and beliefs about social, political, economic and historical contexts\nthat construct diversity and inequality At the 100-level: Instructors should\naddress a minimum of 2 of the learning outcomes. At\nthe 200-level: Instructors should address a minimum of 3 of\nthe learning outcomes from at least two categories. Criteria addressed\nshould be identified on the syllabus and guidelines for respectful\nacademic interaction in the classroom should be established. KNOWLEDGE Identifies\nprivilege (dominant culture, effects on others, etc.) and its relationship\nto social justice issues in community life, politics, and government.\nExpresses how their own attitudes and beliefs differ from those\nof other cultures. Compares and contrasts various values and beliefs\nin the context of historical and geopolitical events. Examines identity\nand race as a social and cultural construct from multiple\nperspectives with a focus on self-awareness. SKILLS Examines research on\nrace and culture. Analyzes social justice from the perspectives of\nhuman rights, dignity and freedom.

Reflects on how their\nnational and cultural identities have been shaped. Approved by the\nUW-Parkside Faculty Senate on May 7, 2013. Teamwork Teamwork Background\n| The approved description of teamwork within UWPs General Education\nProgram is working effectively with others for a common goal.\nThe outcome is housed under Social and Personal Responsibility and\ntherefore reflects behavior more than the product. The academic value\nof the product would likely be addressed by some combination\nof outcomes under Communication and Reasoned Judgment. For teamwork to\nbe a viable learning outcome, the following conditions must be\nmet: The team or group interactions should result in a\nspecific product or products such as research projects, papers, presentations,\nor performances. The product(s) should contribute at least 20% toward\na students overall grade in the course and at least\n15% of the course grade should reflect the process of\nteamwork. The ratio between product and process does not have\nto be maintained. Feedback must occur at a minimum of\nthree times during the semester and at intervals that allow\nfor significant gains in student development. The criteria, explained below,\nare based on the AAC&U Teamwork VALUE rubric https://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics. As\nsuch, the following definition of teamwork is adopted: Teamwork is\nbehaviors under the control of individual team members (effort they\nput into team tasks, their manner of interacting with others\non team, and the quantity and quality of contributions they\nmake to team discussions). The four criteria that must be\naddressed are: Contributions to team meetings Facilitation of contributions of\nother team members Individual contributions outside of team meetings Contributions\nto team climate Instructors may wish to add responds to\nconflict, present in the value rubric, as a criterion. It\nis important to note that these criteria should include the\nquality of contribution in addition to the process of contribution.\nAt a minimum, 100-level courses should seek to reach level\n2 in terms of performance and 200- level courses should\nseek to reach level 3. TEAMWORK RUBRIC LEVEL 2 LEVEL\n3 Contributes to Team Meetings Offers new suggestions to advance\nthe work of the group. Offers alternative solutions or courses\nof action that build on the ideas of others Facilitates\nthe Contributions of Team Members Engages team members in ways\nthat facilitate their contributions to meetings by restating the views\nof other team members and/or asking questions for clarification. Engages\nteam members in ways that facilitate their contributions to meetings\nby constructively building upon or synthesizing the contributions of others\nIndividual Contributions Outside of Team Meetings Completes all assigned tasks\nby deadline; work accomplished advances the project. Completes all assigned\ntasks by deadline; work accomplished is thorough, comprehensive, and advances\nthe project Fosters Constructive Team Climate Supports a constructive team\nclimate by doing any two of the following: Treats team\nmembers respectfully by being polite and constructive in communication. Conveys\na positive attitude about the team and its work. Motivates\nteammates by expressing confidence about the importance of the task\nand the team's ability to accomplish it. Provides assistance and/or\nencouragement to team members.

A checklist of course requirements, including\na sample syllabus statement, is provided below. COMMUNICATION LITERACY General\nEducation Minimum Course Expectations Communication | Literacy Literacy | Reading\nand writing for understanding and effective communication At the 100-level,\ninstructors may opt to emphasize reading within a discipline over\nwriting. Assignments should be constructed so that feedback occurs at\nleast 6 times throughout the semester. At the 200-level, instructors\nare expected to include both reading and writing components. Assignments\nshould be constructed so that feedback occurs at least 4\ntimes throughout the semester. Criteria addressed should be identified on\nthe syllabus. READING EXPECTATIONS Requirement. For traditional first-year students, new\nto the discipline/topic, the time spent per week should be\napproximately two hours per credit-hour. Therefore for a 3-credit class,\nstudents are expected to complete 6-hours of reading. In some\ndisciplines that might be equivalent to 100-pages per week, in\nothers 30-40. Evidence of the requirement should be measured by\na minimum of two of the following: 1. Comprehends vocabulary\nappropriately to summarize or paraphrase the information. 2. Applies knowledge\nto a variety of reading assignments. 3. Identifies aspects of\na text to respond to questions posed in assigned tasks.\n4.

WRITING EXPECTATIONS Requirement.\nStudents should write a minimum the equivalent of 12-16 pages\ntyped, doublespaced, normal 12-point font (such as Times or Times\nNew Roman). Examples of some ways in which a course\nmight meet this minimum: 1. Four 3-4-page papers 2. Six\n2-page papers 3. Fourteen 1-page papers 4. Two essay exams\nand five papers (sufficient to achieve the minimum equivalent) 5.\nWeekly in-class writing assignments which are revised and collected into\na portfolio. These are only examples; instructors are free to\ndesign their own \"road\" to the minimum amount of writing\nin keeping with best practices of the individual disciplines. Evidence\nof writing quality should be based on control of syntax\nand mechanics plus a minimum of two of the following:\n1. Demonstrates attention to context, audience, purpose, and to the\nassigned task(s) 2. Uses appropriate content to develop ideas 3.\nConsistency of organization and presentation 4.

Oral Communication Oral Communication | Listening,\nSpeaking, and Presenting Effectively The AAC&U defines oral communication as:\nprepared, purposeful presentation designed to increase knowledge, to foster understanding,\nor to promote change in the listeners' attitudes, values, beliefs,\nor behaviors. At the University of Wisconsin-Parkside, oral communication is\nrecognized as consisting of three components: listening, speaking, and presenting\neffectively. Courses addressing oral communication must include all three components.\nLISTENING Listening is a specific communication skill that is separate\nalbeit interconnected with effective presentation. According to the National Communication\nAssociation, Listening is the process of receiving, constructing meaning from,\nand responding to spoken and/or nonverbal messages. People listen in\norder to comprehend information, critique and evaluate a message, show\nempathy for the feelings expressed by others, or appreciate a\nperformance. Effective listening includes both literal and critical comprehension of\nideas and information transmitted in oral language. (pp. 10-11)1 Students\nshould be explicitly assessed on their listening skills, and there\nshould be documentation provided of the students comprehension, critique, or\naesthetic appreciation through listening. Students should apply criteria while listening\nthat is appropriate for the subject matter of the course\ndisciplinary background. Evidence of effective listening should be documented through\na product such as written assignment, orally-presented assignment, or examination\nperformance. Effective listening should be evaluated by some of the\nfollowing specific criteria:2 Recognition of main ideas Identify supporting details\nRecognize explicit relationships among ideas Recall basic ideas and details\nAttend with an open mind Perceive the speakers or performance\npurpose and organization of ideas and information Discriminate between statements\nof fact and statements of opinion Distinguish between emotional and\nlogical arguments Detect bias and prejudice o Recognize speakers attitude\nSynthesize and evaluate by drawing logical inferences and conclusions Recall\nthe implications and arguments Recognize discrepancies between the speakers verbal\nand non-verbal messages Employ active listening techniques when appropriate Apply\nappropriate aesthetic criteria when assessing an artistic performance SPEAKING Speaking\nout loud in a formal situation can be a stressful\nand difficult and it combines a number of skills. Students\nshould be encouraged to think about the speaking part of\na presentation as separate from the content. The ways in\nwhich one presents the content are a specific communication skill.\nSpeaking is about communicating effectively through volume, enunciation, pace, rhythm,\nand pitch. An effective presentation will involve clear and effective\nspeaking to communicate those ideas. Speaking should be evaluated based\non some of the following criteria: Rate  is the\nspeaker taking time and emphasizing important ideas? Volume  can\nthe speaker be heard? Enunciation  can the speaker be\nunderstood? Rhythm  is there variation in the presentation of\nideas, heightening the most important and allowing for pauses where\nlisteners can absorb important points? Pitch  Is the speaker\nusing a pitch range that is pleasant to listen to\nas opposed to being strident or monotone? While speaking is\nonly one facet of oral communication, speakers should be aware\nof the very basic mechanisms of good speaking in order\nto make their presentations as effective as possible. PRESENTING EFFECTIVELY\nMinimum of 2 oral presentations Presentations in total should be\nfor a minimum of 10 minutes (these could be distributed\nin various ways such as a 3-minute and 7-minute presentation,\ntwo 5-minute presentations, a 2-minute, 2-minute, and 6-minute presentation). Only\npresentations that are 2-minutes in length or longer will count\ntoward fulfilling this criterion. Should be based on research or\nmaterial appropriate for specific disciplinary nature of course Should utilize\nan organizational structure appropriate for the disciplinary background(s) of the\ncourse subject material (i.e., problem solution, story/narrative, sequential/chronological) Should be\ndelivered extemporaneously or with minimal use of script or notes\nShould use nonverbal communication to project confidence and establish a\nconnection with the audience by maintaining eye contact with the\naudience and good posture In cases of group presentations, part\nof the students grade should be based on his/her individual\nperformance during the group presentation Present ethically by using language\nthat is respectful of diverse groups and giving proper attribution\nto source material 1http://www.natcom.org/uploadedFiles/Teaching_and_Learning/Assessment_Resources/PDFSpeaking_and_Listening_Competencies_for_College_Students.pdf 2 Most of these criteria are\ndrawn from the National Communication Associations report on Speaking and\nListening Competencies for College Students. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Information Technology Competence\nCurrent Description | Using modern information technology to retrieve and\ntransmit information Proposed Description | Using modern technology to enhance\ncommunications. This description includes understanding the environment and vocabulary of\nthe technology and any related software. AREAS INCLUDE Functional expertise:\nExpertise in using a computer software tool to enhance communications,\nincluding basic and advanced features of the tool and common\nusage of the tool. Software tools may include, but are\nnot limited to presentation, publishing, spreadsheet, database, web development, graphics,\nartistic software, and at the 100 level, D2L proficiency. Capabilities\nshall include basic and advanced (or beyond basic) abilities. The\nstudent may demonstrate proficiency in one (or more) tools. Computer\nSavvy: Assesses comprehension of the language of computing and its\nintegration into an environment; for example, identifying how computing fits\ninto an organizations operations and/or society; or uses the appropriate\nvocabulary when describing the use of technology to achieve the\ndesired product. Use of English: Appropriate use of English in\nthe final product(s) is expected. A course shall address at\nleast two of these areas. These skills should be assessed\nin at least three assignments, so that techniques may be\npracticed and improved upon. SUGGESTED AREAS FOR ASSESSMENT (Skills such\nas programming, algorithms, and computer system configuration may be assessed\nas part of Reasoned Judgment versus Communication.) Assessment 100-level 200-level\nFunctional Expertise Technical ability in expression: Basic and Advanced features\nBasic features or capabilities 3-5 advanced features or capabilities Computer\nSavvy Technical comprehension Knowledge and usage-level Comprehension, application and/or analysis\nlevels Use of English Functional area: Appropriate application Format, organization,\nappearance, spelling 100-level plus: grammar, style, delivery Creative Expression Creative\nExpression Current Description: Communicating through artistic statement. Proposed Description: Communicating\nthrough or about artistic statement. At all levels: Students will\nexperience and also demonstrate that they understand the centrality of\n'creative expression' to the discipline and art that forms the\nbasis for the coursework as defined by the instructor. At\nthe 100-level, the course should have at least three of\nthe 100-level expectations. At the 200- level, the course should\nincorporate at least two of the 100-level expectations and at\nleast two of the 200-level expectations. These skills should be\nassessed in at least three assignments, so that techniques may\nbe practiced and improved upon. AT THE 100 LEVEL Students\nwill develop, practice, and apply creative expression through original communication\nskills1 in writing, visual art, and/or performing arts, using a\ncommon vocabulary. Students who are creating new artistic works will\nexperience the responsibility of contributing original, sometimes subjective material, open\nfor public and professional critique for which they may be\nasked to defend or explain. Students will critically reflect on\nexperiences in and/or with performance, exhibition, or publication situations. Students\nwill demonstrate understanding of the importance of critique to the\ncreative process. Students will articulate the value of creative expression\nfor individuals, communities, and/or humanity as a whole. AT THE\n200 LEVEL Students will share their work through exhibition, publication,\nand/or performance. Students will apply the fine arts as a\nmeans to understand diversity and the experiences of those who\nare different from oneself. Students will examine creative works both\nstructurally and within larger contexts. 1 This expectation applies to\nstudents communicating through drawing, writing, painting, sculpting, or other original\nexpressions as required by a particular discipline. REASONED JUDGMENT CRITICAL\nTHINKING Critical Thinking Critical Thinking | Applying logic and reasoning\nto problems solving Critical thinking is a habit of mind\ncharacterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and\nevents before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion. There\nare four major components of Critical Thinking: Exploration: Students will\narticulate an issue by explaining ambiguity and identifying boundaries of\nthe issue and relevant context. Evidence: Students will interpret and\nevaluate information from relevant and reliable sources. Influence of points\nof view: Students will identify their own and others point\nof view when presenting a position on an issue. Conclusions:\nStudents will make conclusions which acknowledge complexity. These skills should\nbe assessed in at least two assignments, so that techniques\nmay be practiced and improved upon. AT THE 100-LEVEL Students\nwill fully state, describe, and clarify an issue or problem.\nStudents will analyze and interpret information from at least two\nrelevant and reliable sources. Students will identify their own and\nothers assumptions when presenting a position on an issue. Students\nwill make conclusions that are tied to a range of\ninformation. AT THE 200-LEVEL Students will fully and concisely state,\ndescribe, and clarify an issue or problem and deliver relevant\ninformation necessary for understanding of the issue or problem. Students\nwill analyze, interpret, and synthesize information from multiple relevant and\nreliable sources. Students will identify their own and others assumptions\nand several relevant contexts when presenting a position on an\nissue. Students will make conclusions that are tied to a\nrange of information, including alternative viewpoints. Ethical Thinking Ethical Thinking\nEthical Thinking | Recognizing and analyzing ethical issues and actions\nAt the 100-level, instructors should address a minimum of 2\nof the learning outcomes. At the 200-level, instructors should address\na minimum of 3 of the learning outcomes from at\nleast two categories. Criteria addressed should be identified on the\nsyllabus. KNOWLEDGE 1. Describes their own core beliefs and articulate\nthe origins of these beliefs. 2. Compares and contrasts their\nbeliefs with others objectively in various social contexts. 3. Compares\nand contrasts the consequences/ramifications of actions that have multiple implications.\nSKILLS 1. Applies ethical perspectives/concepts in multiple scenarios. 2. Applies\nethical perspectives/concepts using an alternative perspective in multiple scenarios. 3.\nEvaluates ethical issues from multiple perspectives. Approved by the UW-Parkside\nFaculty Senate on May 7, 2013. SCIENTIFIC THINKING Scientific Thinking\nScientific Thinking | Understanding and applying the scientific method. At\nthe 100-level: Instructors should emphasize at least two expectations from\nthe skills category. At the 200-level: Instructors should emphasize at\nleast two expectations from the skills category and one from\nthe attitudes/behaviors category. Criteria addressed should be identified on the\nsyllabus. KNOWLEDGE (embedded) All general education courses addressing scientific thinking\nare expected to identify relevant content knowledge in terms of\nthe appropriate principles, theories and methods. SKILL Recognizes the application\nof the scientific method in solving contemporary problems. Critically evaluates\ninformation and sources. Converts relevant information into various forms (e.g.\ncharts, graphs, tables, figures). ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS Considers alternate, divergent,\nor contradictory perspectives or ideas. Includes novel or unique approaches\nto problems or ideas. Supporting Information | The criteria presented\nabove were developed through conversations with department chairs/directors in the\nCollege of Natural and Health Sciences, and by using the\nAAC&U Value rubrics for quantitative literacy and creative thinking (www.aacu.org/value/rubrics).\nAnalytical Skills Analytical Skills Analytical skills: Understanding how to produce\nand interpret quantitative and qualitative information. In an effort to\nsustain the emphasis on qualitative and quantitative information and the\ntwo-fold emphasis of interpretation and production of the information, this\nexpectation is framed around three criteria: identification, analysis and conclusion.\nTherefore, the skill cannot be separated from the issue/problem that\nthe information represents. It was our intent to provide a\nframework that would allow instructors to develop course specific outcomes.\nFurthermore, it is important to realize the natural overlap of\nthis outcome with critical thinking and communication. The expectation was\ndeveloped from three AAC&U Value Rubrics Inquiry and Analysis, Problem\nSolving and Quantitative Literacy. Courses at the 100-level are expected\nto address one sub-point under each criterion; courses at the\n200-level are also expected to address all the criteria, but\nshould address at least one additional sub-point under one of\nthe criteria. In an effort to ensure that students receive\nfeedback on developing their analytical skills and to accommodate courses\nwhere the associated assignment is a final, end-of-semester project/report, the\nCommittee requires that students receive feedback at least 3 times\nduring the semester. This will require that instructors focussing on\nan end-of-semester project/report create milestones throughout the semester. Syllabi should\nidentify GE learning goals and outcomes using approved language. For\nthis expectation, syllabi should also identify the relevant sub points,\nbut the outcomes should be stated in the form appropriate\nto the course. Identifying the Issue/Problem  Students construct a\nclear statement of the issue/problem. Sub-points Students can identify evidence\nneeded to examine an issue or problem. Students represent the\nissue/problem in appropriate forms (e.g. charts, graphs, tables, figures, narratives,\netc). Students can convert data/information from one form to another.\nStudents appropriately address the complexity of the issue/problem. Analysis of\nthe Issue/Problem  The analysis indicates the appropriate comprehension of\nthe issue/problem. The analysis is clearly presented and well organized.\nSub-points Design Process - Students incorporate the appropriate elements of\nmethodology/theory in approaching the analysis. This sub-point may also include\naddressing contextual points associated with the problem/issue. Analysis/Calculations - Are\ncorrect and presented appropriately for intended purpose. Conclusion  The\nconclusion is clear, well supported, and logical. Sub points Students\nrecognize the implication and limitations of their analysis. Students identify\nand address assumptions. This may overlap with how the analysis\nis presented. Students recommend, identify, or implement action(s) that address(es)\nthe problem and is supported by the analysis. Students identify\nhow the analysis (information) may be applied to new issues/problems.\nAesthetic Skills Aesthetic Skills Aesthetic skills | Critiquing and appreciating\nthe fine arts At the 100-level | Instructors should address\na minimum total of 3 of the learning outcomes from\nat least two categories. At the 200-level | Instructors should\naddress a minimum total of 4 of the learning outcomes\nfrom at least two categories. Criteria addressed should be identified\non the syllabus, and expectations should be assessed with 3\nor more assignments. APPRECIATION (Affective) Student will: Explain their visceral\nand/or intellectual reaction to artworks in a given media. Contrast\ntheir personal reactions and those of another to one or\nmore artworks on the basis of their formal, material, and\nprocedural elements. Evaluate multiple artworks on the basis of formal,\nmaterial and procedural considerations. Evaluate the quality of an artwork\nin the context of a set of aesthetic criteria. CRITICISM\n(Cognitive) Students will: Describe the formal, material and procedural elements\nin two or more works of art in a given\nmedium, as defined by the instructor. Identify the criteria involved\nin assessing artwork in a given medium and aesthetic criteria\ngenerally. Analyze a work of art or their own personal\nreactions and the reactions of others, in light of aesthetic\ncriteria. Interpret an artwork on the basis of symbolic, historical,\nsocio-political or philosophical considerations. A list of the works consulted\nin preparing this expectation is available upon request. SOCIAL AND\nPERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY Individual Accountability Individual Accountability Individual Accountability | Understanding\nwhat a responsible choice is and that ones present education\nand lifelong learning is a personal responsibility. At the 100-level:\nInstructors should address one expectation from Responsible Choice plus a\nminimum of one other component from each of the remaining\nsections. At the 200-level: Instructors should address one expectation from\nResponsible Choice plus a minimum of three other components using\nboth of the remaining sections. Criteria addressed should be identified\non the syllabus. Responsible choice assumes that all required work\nis completed with evaluation based on the listed components. RESPONSIBLE\nCHOICE Identifies opportunities to expand knowledge, skills, and abilities as\npart of completing required work. Identifies multiple approaches for solving\nthe problem. Approaches may be elementary in scope. Conducts an\nintroductory evaluation of solutions including: history, logic, reasoning, feasibility and\nimpact. Introductory implies that key elements of depth may be\nmissing. Implements the solution in a manner that addresses the\nproblem statement but may ignore relevant contextual factors. CONNECTS TO\nDISCIPLINE AND EXPERIENCE Applies previous knowledge and skills to demonstrate\ncomprehension and performance in novel situations. Compares life experience and\nacademic knowledge to infer differences, as well as similarities, and\nacknowledges perspectives other than own. Uses skills, abilities, theories, or\nmethodologies gained in one situation in a new situation to\ncontribute to understanding of problems or issues. REFLECTION AND SELF-ASSESSMENT\nEvaluates prior learning (past experiences inside and outside of the\nclassroom) with some depth, revealing slightly clarified meanings or indicating\na somewhat broader perspective about educational or life events. Articulates\nstrengths and challenges (within specific performances or events) to increase\neffectiveness in different contexts (through increased self-awareness). Evaluates results relative\nto the problem defined with some consideration of need for\nfurther work. Approved by the UW-Parkside Faculty Senate on May\n7, 2013. SOCIAL JUSTICE Social Justice Current Definition Social Equality\n| Understanding and questioning social, political, economic and historical conditions\nthat construct diversity and inequality Proposed change to Social Justice\nwith the following definition Social Justice | Understanding and questioning\nvalues and beliefs about social, political, economic and historical contexts\nthat construct diversity and inequality At the 100-level: Instructors should\naddress a minimum of 2 of the learning outcomes. At\nthe 200-level: Instructors should address a minimum of 3 of\nthe learning outcomes from at least two categories. Criteria addressed\nshould be identified on the syllabus and guidelines for respectful\nacademic interaction in the classroom should be established. KNOWLEDGE Identifies\nprivilege (dominant culture, effects on others, etc.) and its relationship\nto social justice issues in community life, politics, and government.\nExpresses how their own attitudes and beliefs differ from those\nof other cultures. Compares and contrasts various values and beliefs\nin the context of historical and geopolitical events. Examines identity\nand race as a social and cultural construct from multiple\nperspectives with a focus on self-awareness. SKILLS Examines research on\nrace and culture. Analyzes social justice from the perspectives of\nhuman rights, dignity and freedom.

CIVIC ENGAGEMENT Civic Engagement Civic Engagement\n| To prepare educated, engaged citizens, strengthen democratic values and\ncivic responsibility, address critical societal issues, and contribute to the\npublic good. At the 100-level: Students will demonstrate a responsibility\nto a civic good, and identify intentional ways to contribute\nto a civic good, and demonstrate the ability to work\nactively within community contexts and structures to achieve a civic\ngood. At the 200-level: Students will also work collaboratively with\nothers in the community to achieve a civic good. Global\nPerspective Global Perspective Global Perspective | Acquiring the knowledge and\nskills that provide an understanding of international/global issues and processes\nAt the 100-level: Instructors should address a minimum of 2\nof the learning outcomes. At the 200-level: Instructors should address\na minimum 3 of the learning outcomes from at least\ntwo categories.

Reflects on how their\nnational and cultural identities have been shaped. Approved by the\nUW-Parkside Faculty Senate on May 7, 2013. Teamwork Teamwork Background\n| The approved description of teamwork within UWPs General Education\nProgram is working effectively with others for a common goal.\nThe outcome is housed under Social and Personal Responsibility and\ntherefore reflects behavior more than the product. The academic value\nof the product would likely be addressed by some combination\nof outcomes under Communication and Reasoned Judgment. For teamwork to\nbe a viable learning outcome, the following conditions must be\nmet: The team or group interactions should result in a\nspecific product or products such as research projects, papers, presentations,\nor performances. The product(s) should contribute at least 20% toward\na students overall grade in the course and at least\n15% of the course grade should reflect the process of\nteamwork. The ratio between product and process does not have\nto be maintained. Feedback must occur at a minimum of\nthree times during the semester and at intervals that allow\nfor significant gains in student development. The criteria, explained below,\nare based on the AAC&U Teamwork VALUE rubric https://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics. As\nsuch, the following definition of teamwork is adopted: Teamwork is\nbehaviors under the control of individual team members (effort they\nput into team tasks, their manner of interacting with others\non team, and the quantity and quality of contributions they\nmake to team discussions). The four criteria that must be\naddressed are: Contributions to team meetings Facilitation of contributions of\nother team members Individual contributions outside of team meetings Contributions\nto team climate Instructors may wish to add responds to\nconflict, present in the value rubric, as a criterion. It\nis important to note that these criteria should include the\nquality of contribution in addition to the process of contribution.\nAt a minimum, 100-level courses should seek to reach level\n2 in terms of performance and 200- level courses should\nseek to reach level 3. TEAMWORK RUBRIC LEVEL 2 LEVEL\n3 Contributes to Team Meetings Offers new suggestions to advance\nthe work of the group. Offers alternative solutions or courses\nof action that build on the ideas of others Facilitates\nthe Contributions of Team Members Engages team members in ways\nthat facilitate their contributions to meetings by restating the views\nof other team members and/or asking questions for clarification. Engages\nteam members in ways that facilitate their contributions to meetings\nby constructively building upon or synthesizing the contributions of others\nIndividual Contributions Outside of Team Meetings Completes all assigned tasks\nby deadline; work accomplished advances the project. Completes all assigned\ntasks by deadline; work accomplished is thorough, comprehensive, and advances\nthe project Fosters Constructive Team Climate Supports a constructive team\nclimate by doing any two of the following: Treats team\nmembers respectfully by being polite and constructive in communication. Conveys\na positive attitude about the team and its work. Motivates\nteammates by expressing confidence about the importance of the task\nand the team's ability to accomplish it. Provides assistance and/or\nencouragement to team members. Supports a constructive team climate by\ndoing any three of the following: Treats team members respectfully\nby being polite and constructive in communication. Conveys a positive\nattitude about the team and its work. Motivates teammates by\nexpressing confidence about the importance of the task and the\nteam's ability to accomplish it. Provides assistance and/or encouragement to\nteam members. Evaluation of each criterion should be based on\nat least two of the following sources and various combinations\nmay be employed: Self-assessment of students work in the group\nPeer assessment of students contributions to the group Instructor observation\nof group process Instructor assessment of group product with focus\non coordination Fourth party evaluation such as professional or audience\nfeedback GENERAL EDUCATION COURSE CERTIFICATION CHECKLIST The following checklist may\nbe used when preparing a course for certification for General\nEducation credit.

ETPL Page Difference Between\na Bootcamp, Certificates, Certification Bootcamp, certificate, and certification are commonly\nused terms in education, training, and professional development, and they\nrefer to different achievements and credentials. Here's a breakdown of\ntheir distinct meanings: Bootcamp Definition: Bootcamps are intensive and immersive\ntraining programs that offer a focused and fast-paced approach to\nlearning or skill development. They are typically shorter in duration\ncompared to traditional education or training programs and are designed\nto provide individuals with specific skills or knowledge in a\ncondensed timeframe. Bootcamps can be found in various fields and\nindustries, ranging from technology and fitness to business and language\nlearning. Purpose: The primary purposes of boot camps include: Skill\nAcquisition: Bootcamps are aimed at equipping participants with practical skills\nand knowledge in a particular field or discipline. Whether it's\ncoding, fitness, entrepreneurship, or cybersecurity, the goal is to provide\nhands-on training that prepares individuals for real-world tasks and challenges.\nCareer Transition: Many bootcamps are designed to help individuals switch\ncareers or advance in their current professions. They offer a\nstreamlined path to gaining the skills needed for new job\nopportunities or promotions. Efficiency: Bootcamps emphasize efficiency by condensing the\nlearning process. This appeals to people who want to acquire\nspecific skills quickly and start applying them in a relatively\nshort amount of time. Industry Alignment: Bootcamps often align their\ncurriculum with current industry needs and trends. This ensures that\ngraduates are well-prepared for the demands of the job market.\nHands-On Experience: Bootcamps typically provide hands-on experience and practical projects,\nallowing participants to apply what they've learned in a real-world\ncontext. This experiential learning is a key aspect of boot\ncamp effectiveness. Scope: The scope of boot camps is broad\nand diverse, encompassing a wide range of fields and subjects.\nCertificate Definition: A certificate is a document or official recognition\nprovided by an educational institution, training program, or organization to\nindividuals upon the successful completion of a specific course, program,\nor training regimen. Purpose: Certificates are typically awarded for the\nacquisition of knowledge, skills, or competencies in a particular subject\nor field of study. They serve as proof that an\nindividual has completed a defined curriculum or met specific learning\nobjectives. Scope: Certificates can vary widely in duration and content.\nThey can be awarded for short courses, workshops, seminars, or\nlonger-term programs and may or may not carry college credit.\nCertification Definition: Certification is a formal recognition granted by a\nprofessional organization, industry association, or certifying body to individuals who\nhave demonstrated a certain level of expertise, competence, or mastery\nin a specific profession, trade, or skill. Purpose: Certification serves\nas a validation of an individual's knowledge, skills, and abilities\nwithin a particular field. It often involves passing standardized exams,\nfulfilling experience requirements, and adhering to a code of ethics.\nScope: Certifications are typically associated with professions or industries and\nare often required or strongly preferred by employers. They can\nbe a way for individuals to advance their careers, demonstrate\ntheir expertise, or meet regulatory or industry-specific standards. In summary,\nwhile both certificates and certifications are credentials obtained through education\nand training, certificates are generally awarded for completing specific courses\nor programs and are more common in traditional education settings.\nCertifications are typically earned through assessments or evaluations of skills\nand knowledge by professional organizations and are often linked to\nspecific careers or industries.

ETPL Page Difference Between\na Bootcamp, Certificates, Certification Bootcamp, certificate, and certification are commonly\nused terms in education, training, and professional development, and they\nrefer to different achievements and credentials. Here's a breakdown of\ntheir distinct meanings: Bootcamp Definition: Bootcamps are intensive and immersive\ntraining programs that offer a focused and fast-paced approach to\nlearning or skill development. They are typically shorter in duration\ncompared to traditional education or training programs and are designed\nto provide individuals with specific skills or knowledge in a\ncondensed timeframe. Bootcamps can be found in various fields and\nindustries, ranging from technology and fitness to business and language\nlearning. Purpose: The primary purposes of boot camps include: Skill\nAcquisition: Bootcamps are aimed at equipping participants with practical skills\nand knowledge in a particular field or discipline.

They offer a\nstreamlined path to gaining the skills needed for new job\nopportunities or promotions. Efficiency: Bootcamps emphasize efficiency by condensing the\nlearning process. This appeals to people who want to acquire\nspecific skills quickly and start applying them in a relatively\nshort amount of time. Industry Alignment: Bootcamps often align their\ncurriculum with current industry needs and trends. This ensures that\ngraduates are well-prepared for the demands of the job market.\nHands-On Experience: Bootcamps typically provide hands-on experience and practical projects,\nallowing participants to apply what they've learned in a real-world\ncontext. This experiential learning is a key aspect of boot\ncamp effectiveness. Scope: The scope of boot camps is broad\nand diverse, encompassing a wide range of fields and subjects.\nCertificate Definition: A certificate is a document or official recognition\nprovided by an educational institution, training program, or organization to\nindividuals upon the successful completion of a specific course, program,\nor training regimen. Purpose: Certificates are typically awarded for the\nacquisition of knowledge, skills, or competencies in a particular subject\nor field of study. They serve as proof that an\nindividual has completed a defined curriculum or met specific learning\nobjectives. Scope: Certificates can vary widely in duration and content.\nThey can be awarded for short courses, workshops, seminars, or\nlonger-term programs and may or may not carry college credit.\nCertification Definition: Certification is a formal recognition granted by a\nprofessional organization, industry association, or certifying body to individuals who\nhave demonstrated a certain level of expertise, competence, or mastery\nin a specific profession, trade, or skill. Purpose: Certification serves\nas a validation of an individual's knowledge, skills, and abilities\nwithin a particular field. It often involves passing standardized exams,\nfulfilling experience requirements, and adhering to a code of ethics.\nScope: Certifications are typically associated with professions or industries and\nare often required or strongly preferred by employers. They can\nbe a way for individuals to advance their careers, demonstrate\ntheir expertise, or meet regulatory or industry-specific standards. In summary,\nwhile both certificates and certifications are credentials obtained through education\nand training, certificates are generally awarded for completing specific courses\nor programs and are more common in traditional education settings.\nCertifications are typically earned through assessments or evaluations of skills\nand knowledge by professional organizations and are often linked to\nspecific careers or industries.

Professors and community partners work together to develop\nprojects that allow students to enhance their classroom knowledge, develop\nleadership skills, network with community leaders, and meet identified community\nneeds. Each year, about 50 courses are matched to community\norganizations and about 1,000 students across majors participate. Projects cover\nmany professional areas, such as research, marketing plans, strategic plans,\ngraphic design, web design, database design, security audits, GIS mapping,\ncommunication plans, personnel training, conflict resolution, and more.

Guskin Center for Community and Business\nEngagement can help you: Find a community partner whose needs\nmatch the learning objectives of your course Arrange for a\ncommunity partner to come to class or meet with faculty\nand/or students Conduct training/orientation for students Provide templates of contracts,\ntime sheets, etc. Identify resources on best practices of of\nCBL Connect you with other faculty on campus who are\nexperienced in CBL If you are interested in learning more\nabout community-based learning or integrating it into your courses, contact\nthe Community Engagement office at cblinfo@uwp.edu. CBL Course Designation Permanent\nCourse Designation A permanent CBL course designation has many benefits\nfor both faculty and students. The permanent designation demonstrates a\ncommitment from the academic department to include CBL as a\nhigh-impact practice in a particular course regardless of who teaches\nthe course or the format. A permanent designation allows faculty,\nadvisors and students to see the designation in the course\ncatalog and plan accordingly. This is especially helpful for students\nif they need to take a CBL course for the\nCommunity Engagement Certificate, or if students want to avoid taking\nmultiple CBL courses at once because of workload concerns. A\npermanent CBL designation also reduces the administrative burden of needing\nto complete one-time course designation requests every time a course\nis offered. The CIM Course form is used to add\na new CBL course or to add the CBL designation\nto an existing course. Visit the Academic Planning Resources webpage\nfor more information on how to add new courses or\nchange existing courses in CIM. Requests for permanent course designation\nare reviewed by the CBL Steering Committee and then sent\nto the CCC for final approval. Note: If you are\nadding, changing or removing a CBL designation, you will use\nthe same CIM Course form. One-time Course Designation The Miscellaneous\nCIM form is used to request approval for a one-time\nCBL designation. The one-time designation form requires the same information\nas the permanent course designation and will be reviewed by\nthe CBL Steering Committee. It does not require approval by\nCCC and the course will not be designated as CBL\nin the course catalog. Select the Propose New Miscellaneous button.\nAfter the form opens, select from the request type drop\ndown  One-time CBL designation Once the form is completed,\nselect the START WORKFLOW button at the bottom of the\npage.

Professors and community partners work together to develop\nprojects that allow students to enhance their classroom knowledge, develop\nleadership skills, network with community leaders, and meet identified community\nneeds. Each year, about 50 courses are matched to community\norganizations and about 1,000 students across majors participate. Projects cover\nmany professional areas, such as research, marketing plans, strategic plans,\ngraphic design, web design, database design, security audits, GIS mapping,\ncommunication plans, personnel training, conflict resolution, and more. CBE Stories:\nAbout Students, Faculty, and Partners Community-Based Learning is for everyone.\nFOR STUDENTS  CBL INFORMATION What is Community-Based Learning (CBL)?\nHow many times have you spent hours on a paper\nor project, only for it to be seen and graded\nby the instructor, and then filed away or thrown out?\nWith community-based learning, you do real projects that make a\ndifference in the community. For example: instead of creating a\nbrochure for an invented company, you produce a brochure for\na local nonprofit organization that is used long after your\ngrade is recorded. During this process, you: Learn how to\nwork with a client Learn more about the community in\nwhich you live Contribute a valuable service to the community\nAdd to your resume or portfolio Make contacts that will\nbe valuable to your career List of CBL Courses Benefits\nof CBL Provides an opportunity to apply classroom learning to\nreal life settings Enhances your understanding of subject matter Reinforces\nlectures and readings Connects students to each other Helps with\nproblem solving Promotes personal growth Enhances your self esteem Breaks\ndown ethnocentrism Develops leadership skills Broadens your world view Promotes\nfurther community involvement Enhances career development Helps solidify ideas of\nfuture career plans Builds resumes Develops networks Connects students with\nfuture job opportunities Opportunities to be involved with Civic Engagement\nCommunity-Based Learning Courses Take a course that is designated as\nproviding CBL credit Community Engagement Certificate Take multiple courses designated\nas providing CBL credit that can count towards a Certificate\nin Community Engagement Certificate Information FOR FACULTY  CBL INFORMATION\nCommunity-Based Learning, or academic service-learning, is a teaching and learning\nstrategy that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection\nto enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen\ncommunities. The Alan E. Guskin Center for Community and Business\nEngagement can help you: Find a community partner whose needs\nmatch the learning objectives of your course Arrange for a\ncommunity partner to come to class or meet with faculty\nand/or students Conduct training/orientation for students Provide templates of contracts,\ntime sheets, etc. Identify resources on best practices of of\nCBL Connect you with other faculty on campus who are\nexperienced in CBL If you are interested in learning more\nabout community-based learning or integrating it into your courses, contact\nthe Community Engagement office at cblinfo@uwp.edu. CBL Course Designation Permanent\nCourse Designation A permanent CBL course designation has many benefits\nfor both faculty and students. The permanent designation demonstrates a\ncommitment from the academic department to include CBL as a\nhigh-impact practice in a particular course regardless of who teaches\nthe course or the format. A permanent designation allows faculty,\nadvisors and students to see the designation in the course\ncatalog and plan accordingly. This is especially helpful for students\nif they need to take a CBL course for the\nCommunity Engagement Certificate, or if students want to avoid taking\nmultiple CBL courses at once because of workload concerns. A\npermanent CBL designation also reduces the administrative burden of needing\nto complete one-time course designation requests every time a course\nis offered. The CIM Course form is used to add\na new CBL course or to add the CBL designation\nto an existing course. Visit the Academic Planning Resources webpage\nfor more information on how to add new courses or\nchange existing courses in CIM. Requests for permanent course designation\nare reviewed by the CBL Steering Committee and then sent\nto the CCC for final approval. Note: If you are\nadding, changing or removing a CBL designation, you will use\nthe same CIM Course form. One-time Course Designation The Miscellaneous\nCIM form is used to request approval for a one-time\nCBL designation. The one-time designation form requires the same information\nas the permanent course designation and will be reviewed by\nthe CBL Steering Committee. It does not require approval by\nCCC and the course will not be designated as CBL\nin the course catalog. Select the Propose New Miscellaneous button.\nAfter the form opens, select from the request type drop\ndown  One-time CBL designation Once the form is completed,\nselect the START WORKFLOW button at the bottom of the\npage. If you have questions about required information, please contact\nAmy Garrigan at garrigan@uwp.edu.

Reflection asks the following questions: What? What did I\ndo and observe? What issue am I addressing? So what?\nWhat impact is my experience having on me? What did\nI do that was effective and why? What was not\neffective and how might I improve on this? What have\nI learned about myself? Now what? What commitment am I\nmaking to my community as a result of this project?\nWhat other projects might I seek out that offer civic\nengagement? Additional reflection prompts can be found in the Guskin\nCenter Reflection Guide.

This year, 1,946\nindividuals across the nation participated in the day through donating,\nvolunteering, and attending events. Parkside Day generated $220,046 in donations\nto scholarships, athletics, and programs of the university from 1,139\ndonors. The number of donors and dollars raised  1,139\nindividuals and businesses making financial contributions  is significant to\nUW-Parkside, as the highest dollar amount and number of donors\nto date for the annual Parkside Day. From our alumni\nto our corporate partners, faculty and staff members, and hundreds\nof supporters throughout the region, our community showed incredible support\nfor UW-Parkside on Parkside Day, said Chancellor Debbie Ford. The\nfunds raised for student success are important, and the highlight\nwas seeing such strong engagement and pride in our university.\nA highlighted giving area was the Future Focus Fund, the\nUW-Parkside Foundations need-based student aid fund which helps students facing\nfinancial hardship stay on track to earning their degrees. Parkside\nDay recognized this years Future Focus corporate supporters: HARIBO of\nAmerica, Snap-on Incorporated, and CNH Industrial. HARIBOs generous presenting sponsorship\nencouraged donors to participate in giving, with additional support to\nthe Future Focus Fund through special challenges for recent alumni\ngiving and power hour fundraising challenges, as well as challenges\nin support of Parkside Athletics teams. The impact of Parkside\nDay extended beyond the dollars raised through the Rangers Give\nBack initiative powered by Goodwill Industries of Southeastern Wisconsin and\nMetropolitan Chicago. The Rangers Give Back initiative provides opportunities for\nUW-Parkside students, staff, and community members to volunteer locally and\nin other communities. In 24 hours, 317 individuals volunteered, contributing\n403 hours of service. On-campus Rangers Give Back activities included\na blood drive sponsored by Versiti Blood Center of Wisconsin,\noutdoor campus clean-up opportunities, and Clean the World hygiene kit\npacking. Volunteers packed 1,000 hygiene kits, and the majority were\ngiven to the Shalom Center. Nearly 700 members of the\nUW-Parkside community attended Parkside Day events on-campus including 110 alumni\nwho returned to campus. In addition to Rangers Give Back,\nUW-Parkside hosted the Parkside Day Launch Party sponsored by Rustic\nRoad Brewing Company, the Parkside Day Picnic, the Ranger Reunion\npresented by the UW-Parkside Alumni Association, and more. Toni Hansen,\ndirector of human resources for HARIBO of America, was energized\nby the generosity and engagement that Parkside Day inspired. HARIBO\nis committed to giving back to the vibrant community in\nsoutheastern Wisconsin, and our partnership with UW-Parkside is an important\npart of that commitment. On Parkside Day, we support and\nencourage others to support programs like the Future Focus Fund\nthat provides critical support to students paving the way for\ntomorrows workforce. As a UW-Parkside alumna, it made me proud\nto see how many alumni were motivated by the HARIBO\ngiving challenges, and how many people came out to celebrate\nand give back. Thats what Parkside Day is all about,\nshe explained. Additional information about Parkside Day and 2023 results\nis available at www.uwp.edu/parkside-day.

Now I can spend time in\nthe classroom with my students without worrying so much about\npossibility of getting anybody sick and vice versa. It is\nso important to get vaccinated so that we can try\nto get back to normal and resude the risk for\neveryone! Gauri Sapkal Research Technical Analyst The reliability of the\nvaccine is a different aspect but I believe that if\nthe vaccination can prevent keeping you away from the disease\nand keep others around you safe, then why not? Susan\nLincke Professor | Computer Science I weighed the risk of\na still-novel vaccine versus getting the disease, and by far\ngetting the disease is much worse. Even those who get\nthrough the disease often have long lasting effects: mental or\nphysical ailments. The idea of a pipe down my throat\ndoes NOT sound fun. If people hurt from the second\ndose of the vaccine, how much worse is the disease?\nWith the vaccine I will feel better about traveling to\nvisit family, eating out, coming to school in the fall.\n:-) Ariana Severo Applied Health Sciences | Student I received\nthe vaccination because I wanted to feel more safe when\ngoing out in public. I also did it for the\nsafety of my family. Chloe Grooters Applied Health Sciences |\nStudent I chose to get vaccinated because it helps us\nas a community to reach herd immunity so that we\ncan all return to campus and not have to worry\nabout spreading covid again. I think it is important that\npeople get vaccinated not only to protect themselves but also\neveryone around them. Alyssa Nepper University Photographer I chose to\nget vaccinated for several resasons: the most important reason being\nmy sister. I also wanted to make sure that the\npeople around me that I care about very much are\nprotected - especially those that are immunocompromised and are unable\nto get vaccinated. Lastly, after being extremely careful, yet still\ngetting COVID-19 and still going through \"long COVID\" 5 months\nlater. I do not want to go through this never-ending\nnightmare again. Philip Wagner Assistant Professor | Criminal Justice I\ngot vaccinated because I have underlying health conditions and couldnt\nthink of a reason not to, not with a deadly\npandemic raging. We're all in this together, and it's only\ntogether that we can vaccinate enough of ust to return\nto a semblance of normalcy. Suly Perez IPED Teacher Candidate\nI chose to get vaccinated, because I am going on\nvacation soon and didnt want to risk getting COVID-19 before\nleaving for vacation and having to cancel. I also did\nit for my family members. Samantha Nickell Student I got\nvaccinated so that I can visit family members without putting\nthem at risk of getting sick. Its important that people\nget vaccinated so that we can start seeing a more\nnormal world again. Makyla Severson Applied Health Sciences | Student\nI chose to get vaccinated because I want to be\nable to get back to the lives we once had\nbefore the outbreak. I miss being able to get together\nwith my extended family for holidays and going to fun\nplaces like waterparks/theme parks and being vaccinated can help me\nget back to those things without as much worry. Dalinda\nGalaviz HR Business Analyst 1. Vaccination can mean the difference\nbetween life and death. 2. My family and friends are\nthe most important people in my life and we need\neach other. 3. Why take the risk of getting very\nsick Hillary Vara Academic Advisor | Nursing I chose to\nget vaccinated as a proud granddaughter, daughter, sister, colleague and\nstudent academic advisor. I trust the science and as someone\nwho is lucky to work with and be surrounded by\nnurses and scientists in my profession, I follow their lead\nand want to be part of the solution. I believe\nby getting vaccinated I am doing my part and advocating\nto be back on campus with students in my office!\nDina Kaye Head Library Collections There are 3 reasons: 1.\nI don't want to find out how serious it would\nbe for me if I got COVID. 2. I don't\nwant to give COVID to my family and friends; especially\nmy 96-year-old mom. 3. I want to see this country\nget back on its feet again which means doing my\npart. Lexis Brown Psychology | Student I chose to get\nvaccinated to keep both myself and the people around me\nsafe.

But as the stars come out and the conversation gets rolling, it becomes clear that Gerald and Laura might not be all that they appear to be. Over the course of a crazy, starlit dinner party, the wildly unexpected occurs. The couples begin to flirt and insanity reigns. Martin, using his trademark absurdist humor, bends the fluid nature of time and reality to create a surprising and unforgettably funny new play.\nBuy Tickets\n\n\nContact(s):\nRita Box Office\n262-595-2564 boxoffice@uwp.edu\n\n\nhttps://www.uwp.edu/therita/theatreperformances.cfm\n\n\n\n\n         \n Add to Calendar\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply NowVisit CampusRequest InfoVirtual Tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT WITH US\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Life\nAcademics\nAdmissions\nAthletics, Art, Culture\nAlumni & Partners\nUWP Information\nHLC Accreditation\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Police\nCampus Safety\nGiving\nContact Us\nCalendar\nApply\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\nApplicants\nAdmitted Students\nCurrent Students\nFaculty & Staff\n\n\n\n\nAlumni\nDonors\nMedia\nCommunity Members\nAdult Learner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But as the stars come out and the conversation gets rolling, it becomes clear that Gerald and Laura might not be all that they appear to be. Over the course of a crazy, starlit dinner party, the wildly unexpected occurs. The couples begin to flirt and insanity reigns. Martin, using his trademark absurdist humor, bends the fluid nature of time and reality to create a surprising and unforgettably funny new play.\nBuy Tickets\n\n\nContact(s):\nRita Box Office\n262-595-2564 boxoffice@uwp.edu\n\n\nhttps://www.uwp.edu/therita/theatreperformances.cfm\n\n\n\n\n         \n Add to Calendar\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply NowVisit CampusRequest InfoVirtual Tour\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONNECT WITH US\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Life\nAcademics\nAdmissions\nAthletics, Art, Culture\nAlumni & Partners\nUWP Information\nHLC Accreditation\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Police\nCampus Safety\nGiving\nContact Us\nCalendar\nApply\nSite Map\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\nApplicants\nAdmitted Students\nCurrent Students\nFaculty & Staff\n\n\n\n\nAlumni\nDonors\nMedia\nCommunity Members\nAdult Learner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

THE FILMS Film History Database Close Belgium | 2022\n| Lukas Dhont | French language | 1h 44m Sep\n14-17, 2023 In rural Belgium, two thirteen-year-old boys, Lo and\nRmi, are best friends who exhibit a deeply intimate affection\nfor one another. After a carefree summer together, the two\nboys start middle school and find themselves in the same\nclass and with a whole new set of social challenges\nto their friendship. Close is a miraculously subtle Belgian drama\npacking a formidable emotional wallop, so cumulatively affecting because it\nis carried off with no affect whatsoever--even the gorgeous, string-led\nscore is understated. The disintegration of a friendship between two\nboys on the cusp of adolescence in rural Belgium triggers\na tragedy. A study of children confronted with the kind\nof grief that they have neither the maturity nor the\ntemperamental framework to fully understand is always going to be\na powerful proposition, but the combination of knock-out performances and\ndirection of uncommon sensitivity from Dhont makes for a picture\nwhich is intimate in scope but packs a considerable punch.\nIMDb The Blue Caftan Morocco | 2022 | Maryam Touzani\n| Arabic language | 2h 2m Sep 21-24, 2023 Halim\nis more than a tailor. At the traditional shop in\na Moroccan medina that he runs with his ailing wife\nMina, he works lovingly and painstakingly hand-embroidering silks so exquisitely\nfine they are like wearing air. And in a way,\nthis delicate, precise, time- consuming approach is mirrored in director\nMaryam Touzanis film-making, with its focus on tiny details, the\nfleeting glance, an almost imperceptible brush of skin against skin.\nIt is a gentle piece of Arabic-language storytelling, one that\nsoftly, slowly enfolds the audience rather than propels them on\na journey. Halim, with his sad eyes and melodic, minor-key\nvoice, loves his wife deeply, but the couple live with\nthe secret of his homosexuality, something Mina has come to\naccept but that still generates an occasional stab of jealousy\nin her. When a new apprentice, Youssef, joins them, she\nis aware of the attraction between the two men. There\nis a sharp edge to her manner when she talks\nto Youssef, but the dynamic between the three subtly shifts\nover time. As Minas health fails, she weaves Youssef into\nthe fabric of her own present and her husbands future\nlife. IMDb Corsage Austria | 2022 | Marie Kreutzer |\nGerman language | 1h 54m Oct 5-8, 2023 Set in\nthe 1870s, Corsage depicts Elisabeth Empress of Austria at 40,\nstruggling to maintain her flawless image and that of the\nempire she is expected to incarnate. Elisabeths aura of lofty\ngrace depends on her rigorous control of her body, which\ninvolves the corsetry of the title being laced mercilessly tight,\nas well as workouts with exercise rings in her private\ngym. Enduring a politely loveless marriage to the emperor, Franz\nJoseph, Sissi yearns for affection, or libidinous release, but it\nevades her. One candidate is an English riding master, whom\nshe visits in Northamptonshire; significantly, although Corsage does not specify\nthis, Elisabeths actual historical visit was to none other than\nthe Spencers at Althorp. Elisabeth is most relaxed when spending\ntime with her famously troubled relation Ludwig of Bavaria, but\nhe discreetly rejects her less cousinly attentions, prompting her to\nask, in the films drollest line: So the rumours about\nthe stable boys are true? IMDb One Fine Morning France\n| 2022 | Mia Hansen-Lve | French language | 1h\n52m Oct 19-22, 2023 With a father suffering from neurodegenerative\ndisease, a young woman lives with her eight-year-old daughter. While\nstruggling to secure a decent nursing home, she runs into\nan unavailable friend with whom she embarks on an affair.\nThe film explores love, both romantic and familial, with no\ntrace of drama or sappiness, and without ever feeling slight.\nIt is a balm of a film and another glorious\nshowcase for Hansen-Lves light touch when dealing with complicated emotions.\nOne Fine Morning is concerned with lifes curveballs and catastrophes\nas well as its unforeseen joys. IMDb Broker South Korea\n| 2022 | Kore-eda Hirokazu | Korean language | 2h\n9m Nov 2-5, 2023 A young lady decides to give\nup her newborn child to a church for adoption but\ndiscovers that there is an active group that steals these\nchildren for sale. She catches the group red handed and\njoins them in an exciting road trip to find customers\nready to buy the child. Broker is an accessible, high-concept\ngenre movie that brings to mind the Coen brothers. Sang-hyun\nis the owner of a small launderette in Busan. He\nis proud of his work, but he is being leaned\non by local gangsters, so he resorts to another, far\nless legal job: he sells babies. A church near his\nlaunderette has a \"baby box\" by the front door, a\nhatch with a basket inside where new mothers can leave\nunwanted infants. Sang-hyun's big-hearted right-hand man, Dong-soo, works part-time at\nthe church, so if a baby arrives while he is\non duty, he spirits it away and erases the CCTV\nfootage. The partners in crime then set up a black-market\nadoption. The going rate for boys is a lot higher\nthan it is for girls, but they always take care\nto ensure that the baby is going to suitably caring\nparents. Broker keeps on getting funnier and knottier, as secret\nmotives are revealed, sympathies shift, mysteries deepen, and dangers multiply.\nIt is, on one level, a farcical crime caper, but\nit is so elegantly plotted that it never seems contrived.\nIMDb R.M.N. Romania | 2022 | Cristian Mungiu | Romanian\nlanguage | 2h 5m Nov 16-19, 2023 A few days\nbefore Christmas, having quit his job in Germany, Matthias returns\nto his multi-ethnic Transylvanian village. He wishes to involve himself\nmore in the education of his son, Rudi, who has\nbeen left for too long in the care of his\nmother, Ana, and to rid the boy of the unresolved\nfears that have taken hold of him. He is preoccupied\nwith his old father, Otto, and also eager to see\nhis ex-lover, Csilla. When a few new workers are hired\nat the small factory that Csilla manages, the peace of\nthe community is disturbed. The Romanian filmmaker Mungiu returns with\na portrait of Europe, perhaps the world, in the days\nof late capitalism. As bitter and biting as its winter\nlandscape, it stars Marin Grigore as a Hungarian immigrant in\na small village nestled among the snowy forests and sweeping\nmountains of Transylvania. R.M.N. stands for rezonanta magnetica nucleara, or\nnuclear magnetic resonance, a means to scan the brain looking\nfor things below the surface. It is a metaphor played\nout with the health of Matthias father, whose well-being begins\nto falter as the villages racist-fueled anger over the new\nworkers presence begins to fester. IMDb EO Poland | 2022\n| Jerzy Skolimowski | Polish language | 1h 28m Nov\n30-Dec 3, 2023 EO is a donkey working for a\nPolish circus. He performs in an act with Kasandra, who\nloves and protects him. When animal rights activists help get\nthe circus shut down, EO is taken away and brought\nto a horse stable to work. In the truck being\ntransported and at the stables, EO sees horses running free\nand being pampered. After knocking over a shelf of trophies,\nEO is sent to a farm where he seems depressed\nand will not eat. He gives rides to children through\nwoods where trees continue to be cut down to create\nspace for humans. On paper, an existential Polish remake of\na 1960s French arthouse classic about a donkeys journey might\nseem intimidating, uninteresting, flat, droll, inaccessible, high art, but writer/director\nJerzy Skolimowski is a filmmaking wizard.

IMDb Cairo Conspiracy\nSweden | 2022 | Taril Saleh | Arabic language |\n1h 44m Jan 25-28, 2024 Adam, the son of a\nfisherman, is offered the privilege to study at the Al-Azhar\nUniversity in Cairo, the center of power of Sunni Islam.\nAdam becomes a pawn in the conflict between Egypt's religious\nand political elites. The film is set at Cairos Al\nAzhar University, the most prestigious Islamic school in the world,\nfounded in 972. The story is a wild one, a\ntense political thriller centering on Adam, a naive freshman from\nthe sticks who gets recruited as a mole by Col.\nIbrahim, an officer from the state security agency, to manipulate\nthe election of the schools grand imam, one of the\nmost powerful positions in Sunni Islam. The goal is to\nfinagle things by whatever means necessary, so that the governments\npreferred candidate is chosen over another cleric being groomed by\nthe Muslim Brotherhood, a group that some have called a\nterrorist organization. It is an engrossing tale, full of betrayal\nand chicanery, and it casts the Egyptian political-military complex and\nthe religious hierarchy as riddled with corruption.

The film is at\nonce a vivid portrait of a place and its people,\nan unsentimental ode to the art and craft of tequila-making,\na damning depiction of the results of globalizing economic policies,\nand an exquisite character study, with Teresa Snchez delivering a\nperformance of potent restraint. It is rare when a debut\nfeature strikes the perfect balance of ingredients and especially rare\nwhen it does so in a distinctive and memorable way.\nWriter-director Juan Pablo Gonzlez achieves precisely this in Dos Estaciones.\nThe sense of place is powerful, whether the director takes\nus into the fields where the jimadores harvest the agave\nor traces the plants fermentation process through the distillerys machinery,\nor simply invites us to observe the land and the\nsky. This is a drama with great attention to detail\nin those visuals, in the words and silences between characters,\nand in the layers of sound beneath the dialogue. IMDb\nTori & Lokita Belgium | 2022 | Jean-PierreDardenne | French\nlanguage | 1h 28m Feb 22-25, 2024 Tori and Lokita\nis a heart-stopping thriller that casts an unflinching eye on\nthe trials of the young and dispossessed. Like most of\nthe Dardenne brothers work, Tori and Lokita leverages the irreducible\nnature of human dignity against the ever-worsening apathy of human\ncivilization. The films threadbare story hinges on parentless children whose\nneed for support leads them toward danger. The story revolves\naround two underage African immigrants who are posing as siblings\nin order to secure the older Lokitas permission to stay\nas a refugee. Tori and Lokita live together in the\nsame shelter for unaccompanied foreign minors. They deliver drugs together\nfor the same awful drug dealer, and they give most\nof the money they make to the same violent smuggler\nwho helped them get to Belgium in the first place.\nThe kids have been drawn reluctantly into the criminal underworld\nto pay debts and send desperately needed money back home.\nThis may be the Dardennes most emotionally engaging film in\na while--a tragedy told with utter clarity, centered on protagonists\nentirely deserving of our sympathy and empathy. IMDb Abouna Chad\n| 2002 | Mahamat-Saleh Haroun | French language | 1h\n24m Mar 7-10, 2024 The lives of two brothers who\nlive in N'djamena are upended when they awake one Saturday\nmorning to find that their father has left the family.\nThey are Amine, about eight years old, playful and asthmatic,\nand Tahir, fifteen, handsome, quiet, and his brother's protector. The\nboys go in search of their father and find only\ntrouble. Dad's leaving also debilitates their mother. Haroun gives us\na glimpse of central Africa's soul with this simple yet\npowerful tale. The film has an accomplished visual style. It\nis beautifully shot with a superior sense of style and\ncolor, catching the feel of the settings nicely without either\nfalling into clich or locking the action too specifically in\na time or place. This means that even those of\nus who have never experienced such a life can identify\nwith Tafir and Amine's situation. The plot can be read\nallegorically as the story of Chad itself, a people adrift\nand badly in need of returning to their true roots.\nIMDb No Bears Iran | 2022 | Jafar Panahi |\nTurkish language | 1h 46m Mar 14-17, 2024 The rigidity\nof bordersliteral and figurativeis the primary interest of No Bears\nIranian filmmaker Jafar Panahis latest film. Completed two months before\nthe directors most recent arrestculminating in a six-year prison sentence\nfor propaganda against the regime in his native Iranthe film\nis a meta-commentary on the artistic suppression that Panahi has\nbeen increasingly subjected to throughout his career, also currently affecting\na large swath of Iranian filmmakers, artists, and activists. No\nBears incorporates two parallel plot lines. The first involves Panahi\n(who plays himself) covertly renting a room near the Iranian\nborder and secretly overseeing the shoot for his next film,\nwhich is happening in a nearby Turkish city. Restricted from\nleaving Iran (much like the real-life Panahi), he monitors the\nproductions progress via Zoom and cell phone callsthat is, when\nthe frequently-spotty reception allows for it. In his free time,\nhe takes photographs of the small town hes lodging in,\nwith special emphasis on its provincial residents. However, he quickly\nbecomes embroiled in a local scandal involving a photo he\nallegedly took of a young couple whose union is strictly\nforbidden by the towns traditional customs, though he vehemently swears\nthat no such photograph exists. The second storyline occurs within\nPanahis intra-film narrative, which similarly concerns a star-crossed couple. IMDb\nAftersun UK | 2022 | Charlotte Wells | English language\n| 1h 42m Apr 4-7, 2024 Parents and children can\ndevelop a sixth sense about each other, or, at very\nleast, they can attune some of their five basic senses\nto each others wavelengths without even trying, and those sensitivities\nsometimes linger. Aftersun communicates its understanding of this connection right\naway. When Calum, a young father on vacation with his\neleven-year-old daughter Sophie, pauses before leaving her alone for a\nmoment, even though he is out of her sight, she\ncan hear his hesitation. She assures him it is fine\nto leave her. Calums uncertainty makes sense. Gradually, the movie\nreveals the basics of their relationship. Sophies parents are divorced,\nseemingly amicably, at least by this point. Sophie lives with\nher mother in Scotland. Calum lives in London and does\nnot see her as often as either of them might\nlike. Now they are on end-of-summer holiday in Turkey, at\na resort hotel, though Calum cannot afford the all- inclusive\npasses that would get them unlimited food, drink, or whatever\nelse. Eventually, flashes of Sophie as an adult make it\nclear that she is remembering this trip with the help\nof some home videos we see her taking at the\ntime and rewatching later. The movie is mostly from Sophies\npoint of view, but sometimes Wells follows Calum away from\nhis daughters eyes. Are we seeing the truth of those\nmoments, or Sophies attempt to reconstruct them years later? In\nits gentle, modest way, Aftersun might well break your heart.\nIMDb A Hero Iran | 2021 | Asghar Farhadi |\nPersian language | 2h 7m Apr 18-21, 2024 Whats the\nprice for having a conscience?

THE FILMS Film History Database Close Belgium | 2022\n| Lukas Dhont | French language | 1h 44m Sep\n14-17, 2023 In rural Belgium, two thirteen-year-old boys, Lo and\nRmi, are best friends who exhibit a deeply intimate affection\nfor one another. After a carefree summer together, the two\nboys start middle school and find themselves in the same\nclass and with a whole new set of social challenges\nto their friendship. Close is a miraculously subtle Belgian drama\npacking a formidable emotional wallop, so cumulatively affecting because it\nis carried off with no affect whatsoever--even the gorgeous, string-led\nscore is understated. The disintegration of a friendship between two\nboys on the cusp of adolescence in rural Belgium triggers\na tragedy. A study of children confronted with the kind\nof grief that they have neither the maturity nor the\ntemperamental framework to fully understand is always going to be\na powerful proposition, but the combination of knock-out performances and\ndirection of uncommon sensitivity from Dhont makes for a picture\nwhich is intimate in scope but packs a considerable punch.\nIMDb The Blue Caftan Morocco | 2022 | Maryam Touzani\n| Arabic language | 2h 2m Sep 21-24, 2023 Halim\nis more than a tailor. At the traditional shop in\na Moroccan medina that he runs with his ailing wife\nMina, he works lovingly and painstakingly hand-embroidering silks so exquisitely\nfine they are like wearing air. And in a way,\nthis delicate, precise, time- consuming approach is mirrored in director\nMaryam Touzanis film-making, with its focus on tiny details, the\nfleeting glance, an almost imperceptible brush of skin against skin.\nIt is a gentle piece of Arabic-language storytelling, one that\nsoftly, slowly enfolds the audience rather than propels them on\na journey. Halim, with his sad eyes and melodic, minor-key\nvoice, loves his wife deeply, but the couple live with\nthe secret of his homosexuality, something Mina has come to\naccept but that still generates an occasional stab of jealousy\nin her. When a new apprentice, Youssef, joins them, she\nis aware of the attraction between the two men. There\nis a sharp edge to her manner when she talks\nto Youssef, but the dynamic between the three subtly shifts\nover time. As Minas health fails, she weaves Youssef into\nthe fabric of her own present and her husbands future\nlife. IMDb Corsage Austria | 2022 | Marie Kreutzer |\nGerman language | 1h 54m Oct 5-8, 2023 Set in\nthe 1870s, Corsage depicts Elisabeth Empress of Austria at 40,\nstruggling to maintain her flawless image and that of the\nempire she is expected to incarnate. Elisabeths aura of lofty\ngrace depends on her rigorous control of her body, which\ninvolves the corsetry of the title being laced mercilessly tight,\nas well as workouts with exercise rings in her private\ngym. Enduring a politely loveless marriage to the emperor, Franz\nJoseph, Sissi yearns for affection, or libidinous release, but it\nevades her. One candidate is an English riding master, whom\nshe visits in Northamptonshire; significantly, although Corsage does not specify\nthis, Elisabeths actual historical visit was to none other than\nthe Spencers at Althorp. Elisabeth is most relaxed when spending\ntime with her famously troubled relation Ludwig of Bavaria, but\nhe discreetly rejects her less cousinly attentions, prompting her to\nask, in the films drollest line: So the rumours about\nthe stable boys are true? IMDb One Fine Morning France\n| 2022 | Mia Hansen-Lve | French language | 1h\n52m Oct 19-22, 2023 With a father suffering from neurodegenerative\ndisease, a young woman lives with her eight-year-old daughter. While\nstruggling to secure a decent nursing home, she runs into\nan unavailable friend with whom she embarks on an affair.\nThe film explores love, both romantic and familial, with no\ntrace of drama or sappiness, and without ever feeling slight.\nIt is a balm of a film and another glorious\nshowcase for Hansen-Lves light touch when dealing with complicated emotions.\nOne Fine Morning is concerned with lifes curveballs and catastrophes\nas well as its unforeseen joys. IMDb Broker South Korea\n| 2022 | Kore-eda Hirokazu | Korean language | 2h\n9m Nov 2-5, 2023 A young lady decides to give\nup her newborn child to a church for adoption but\ndiscovers that there is an active group that steals these\nchildren for sale. She catches the group red handed and\njoins them in an exciting road trip to find customers\nready to buy the child. Broker is an accessible, high-concept\ngenre movie that brings to mind the Coen brothers. Sang-hyun\nis the owner of a small launderette in Busan. He\nis proud of his work, but he is being leaned\non by local gangsters, so he resorts to another, far\nless legal job: he sells babies. A church near his\nlaunderette has a \"baby box\" by the front door, a\nhatch with a basket inside where new mothers can leave\nunwanted infants. Sang-hyun's big-hearted right-hand man, Dong-soo, works part-time at\nthe church, so if a baby arrives while he is\non duty, he spirits it away and erases the CCTV\nfootage. The partners in crime then set up a black-market\nadoption. The going rate for boys is a lot higher\nthan it is for girls, but they always take care\nto ensure that the baby is going to suitably caring\nparents. Broker keeps on getting funnier and knottier, as secret\nmotives are revealed, sympathies shift, mysteries deepen, and dangers multiply.\nIt is, on one level, a farcical crime caper, but\nit is so elegantly plotted that it never seems contrived.\nIMDb R.M.N. Romania | 2022 | Cristian Mungiu | Romanian\nlanguage | 2h 5m Nov 16-19, 2023 A few days\nbefore Christmas, having quit his job in Germany, Matthias returns\nto his multi-ethnic Transylvanian village. He wishes to involve himself\nmore in the education of his son, Rudi, who has\nbeen left for too long in the care of his\nmother, Ana, and to rid the boy of the unresolved\nfears that have taken hold of him. He is preoccupied\nwith his old father, Otto, and also eager to see\nhis ex-lover, Csilla. When a few new workers are hired\nat the small factory that Csilla manages, the peace of\nthe community is disturbed. The Romanian filmmaker Mungiu returns with\na portrait of Europe, perhaps the world, in the days\nof late capitalism. As bitter and biting as its winter\nlandscape, it stars Marin Grigore as a Hungarian immigrant in\na small village nestled among the snowy forests and sweeping\nmountains of Transylvania. R.M.N. stands for rezonanta magnetica nucleara, or\nnuclear magnetic resonance, a means to scan the brain looking\nfor things below the surface. It is a metaphor played\nout with the health of Matthias father, whose well-being begins\nto falter as the villages racist-fueled anger over the new\nworkers presence begins to fester. IMDb EO Poland | 2022\n| Jerzy Skolimowski | Polish language | 1h 28m Nov\n30-Dec 3, 2023 EO is a donkey working for a\nPolish circus. He performs in an act with Kasandra, who\nloves and protects him. When animal rights activists help get\nthe circus shut down, EO is taken away and brought\nto a horse stable to work. In the truck being\ntransported and at the stables, EO sees horses running free\nand being pampered. After knocking over a shelf of trophies,\nEO is sent to a farm where he seems depressed\nand will not eat. He gives rides to children through\nwoods where trees continue to be cut down to create\nspace for humans. On paper, an existential Polish remake of\na 1960s French arthouse classic about a donkeys journey might\nseem intimidating, uninteresting, flat, droll, inaccessible, high art, but writer/director\nJerzy Skolimowski is a filmmaking wizard. This is a story\nabout a voiceless, armless, homeless, rights-less lead at the whim\nof the forces around him. The perspective triggers a flood\nof empathy and, to Skolimowskis credit, opens an inner reservoir\nwith the capacity to hold it all. IMDb Cairo Conspiracy\nSweden | 2022 | Taril Saleh | Arabic language |\n1h 44m Jan 25-28, 2024 Adam, the son of a\nfisherman, is offered the privilege to study at the Al-Azhar\nUniversity in Cairo, the center of power of Sunni Islam.\nAdam becomes a pawn in the conflict between Egypt's religious\nand political elites.

NEW PARTNERSHIPS FOR LOCAL ECOLOGY\nUW-Parkside and Kenosha County have signed a collaborative agreement aimed\nat improving the ecology and recreational opportunities on 139 acres\nof UW-Parkside property that borders Petrifying Springs Park. These natural\nareas are densely wooded, featuring diverse native species. Under the\nnew, 50-year agreement, Kenosha County will aid in the management\nof the university-owned land, with the two parties working together\non initiatives to improve stormwater and natural resource management. The\n139 acres in the agreement includes roughly 76 acres that\nlie within the Pike River floodplain, which the county is\ncontinuing to proactively protect and restore. The agreement will also\nfacilitate student learning and applied research opportunities. UW-Parkside and the\nRoot-Pike Watershed Initiative Network (WIN) will also partner for the\nPollinator Patch Program. The goal of the program is to\ndevelop a land restoration plan and create more habitat for\nthe Rusty Patched Bumble Bee, a federally endangered species. UW-Parkside\nis in a unique position to rehabilitate and enhance the\napproximately 211 acres of forest and open space between county\nhighways JR and E, and state Highway 31. These areas\nprovide appealing native vegetation and prime habitat for wildlife, including\nthe Rusty Patched Bumble Bee and other pollinators.
