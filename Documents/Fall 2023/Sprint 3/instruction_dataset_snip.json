If you\nare a minor and your parents move out of the\nstate during the 12 months prior to your enrollment at\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Parkside, you will be classified as a nonresident\nunless you have lived in Wisconsin during a substantial portion\nof your life and for the full year before enrollment.\nIf your parents move out of the state, you are\n18 or older, and you are living in the state\nof Wisconsin and maintaining your legal ties, you can retain\nyour resident status for tuition purposes in your own right.\nIf you are 18 or older and move out of\nthe state with your parents, you generally will be considered\na nonresident. What if I am a nonresident and take\na year off of school? See Sections (a)1 and (e)\nof Wisconsin Statutes 36.27(2). If you are a nonresident student\nyou may discontinue enrollment for a twelve-month period to establish\nbona fide residency in Wisconsin for tuition purposes, and you\nmust fulfill the criteria in Section (e) of Wisconsin Statutes\n36.27(2), including timely filing of a Wisconsin income tax return\nof a type only a full-year Wisconsin resident may file,\nWisconsin voter registration, Wisconsin motor vehicle registration, possession of a\nWisconsin operator's license, place of employment, self-support, involvement in community\nactivities, and physical presence in Wisconsin for at least 12\nmonths before classes begin.

When you\nsubmit an application for readmission to the University of Wisconsin-Parkside,\ncheck the \"Yes\" box regarding residency, even if the 12\nmonths has not passed when you reapply. This will alert\nthe Admissions Office of your intent. If I am a\nnonresident -- will I ever become a resident? If you\nenter and remain in Wisconsin principally to attend an educational\ninstitution during the twelve months you are attempting to establish\nbona fide residency in Wisconsin, you are presumed to continue\nto reside outside the state. This presumption remains in effect\nuntil you are able to demonstrate you have overcome the\npresumption with clear and convincing evidence of bona fide residency\nin the state for the year next preceding a term\nfor which you wish to enroll at the University of\nWisconsin-Parkside. Wisconsin Statutes 36.27(2) Section (e). Generally, a student who\nenters Wisconsin to attend any educational institution will continue in\nthe nonresident status until the student's reason for being in\nWisconsin is clearly shown to be non-educational. Twelve months after\nthe change in the student's reason for being in Wisconsin,\nthe student may wish to inquire about appealing their nonresident\nstatus. What is Documentation of Physical Presence? Documentation of Physical\nPresence is used to establish the fact that a person\nhas been physically residing in Wisconsin continuously during a specific\nperiod of time.

You are not limited to these\nexamples, however, and may submit other records more appropriate in\nyour situation. Check with our office to verify that records\nnot included on this list will suffice.

A person with a first-time\nconviction of possession of a controlled substance can be sentenced\nup to one year in prison and fined up to\n$5,000, Wisconsin Statute 961.41 (3r)(a). The penalties vary according to\nthe amount of a drug confiscated, the type of drug\nfound, the number of previous offenses by the individual intended\nto manufacture the drug, sell the drug or use the\ndrug. See Wisconsin Statute 961.41. In addition to the stringent\npenalties for possession or delivery, the sentence can be doubled\nwhen exacerbating factors are present, such as when a person\ndistributes a controlled substance to a minor, Wisconsin 961.46. Substance\nrestrictions against alcohol abuse also exist in Wisconsin. It is\nagainst the law to sell alcohol to anyone who has\nnot reached the legal drinking age of 21 and there\nis a concurrent duty on the part of an adult\nto prevent the illegal consumption of alcohol on his/her premises,\nWisconsin Statute 125.07(1)(a)(1). Violation of this statute can result in\na $500 forfeiture. It is against the law for an\nunderage person to attempt to buy an alcoholic beverage, falsely\nrepresent his/her age or enter licensed premise and can be\nfined $1,250, ordered to participate in a supervised work program,\nand have their drivers license suspended, Wisconsin Statute 125.07(4). Harsher\npenalties exist for the retailers of alcoholic beverages, including up\nto 90 days in jail and revocation of his/her retail\nliquor permit. Federal The federal government has recently revised the\npenalties against drug possession and trafficking through its Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines that reduce the discretion that federal judges may use\nin sentencing offenders of federal drug statutes. Under these guidelines,\ncourts can sentence a person for up to 6 years\nfor unlawful possession of a controlled substance, including the distribution\nof a small amount (less than 250 grams) of marijuana.\nA sentence of life imprisonment can result from a conviction\nof possession of a controlled substance that result in death\nor bodily injury. Possession of more than 5 grams of\ncocaine can trigger an intent to distribute penalty of 10-16\nyears in prison, U.S.S.G.s.2D2.0(b)(1).
