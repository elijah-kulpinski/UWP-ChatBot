Box 7885 Whitewater, WI 53707-7885 (608) 267-2209 http://heab.state.wi.us/\nWhat if I or my family leave Wisconsin? If you\nare a minor and your parents move out of the\nstate during the 12 months prior to your enrollment at\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Parkside, you will be classified as a nonresident\nunless you have lived in Wisconsin during a substantial portion\nof your life and for the full year before enrollment.\nIf your parents move out of the state, you are\n18 or older, and you are living in the state\nof Wisconsin and maintaining your legal ties, you can retain\nyour resident status for tuition purposes in your own right.\nIf you are 18 or older and move out of\nthe state with your parents, you generally will be considered\na nonresident. What if I am a nonresident and take\na year off of school? See Sections (a)1 and (e)\nof Wisconsin Statutes 36.27(2). If you are a nonresident student\nyou may discontinue enrollment for a twelve-month period to establish\nbona fide residency in Wisconsin for tuition purposes, and you\nmust fulfill the criteria in Section (e) of Wisconsin Statutes\n36.27(2), including timely filing of a Wisconsin income tax return\nof a type only a full-year Wisconsin resident may file,\nWisconsin voter registration, Wisconsin motor vehicle registration, possession of a\nWisconsin operator's license, place of employment, self-support, involvement in community\nactivities, and physical presence in Wisconsin for at least 12\nmonths before classes begin. Also, if you are not a\nU.S. citizen, you must be in possession of a visa\nthat permits indefinite residency in the United States. When you\nsubmit an application for readmission to the University of Wisconsin-Parkside,\ncheck the \"Yes\" box regarding residency, even if the 12\nmonths has not passed when you reapply. This will alert\nthe Admissions Office of your intent. If I am a\nnonresident -- will I ever become a resident? If you\nenter and remain in Wisconsin principally to attend an educational\ninstitution during the twelve months you are attempting to establish\nbona fide residency in Wisconsin, you are presumed to continue\nto reside outside the state. This presumption remains in effect\nuntil you are able to demonstrate you have overcome the\npresumption with clear and convincing evidence of bona fide residency\nin the state for the year next preceding a term\nfor which you wish to enroll at the University of\nWisconsin-Parkside. Wisconsin Statutes 36.27(2) Section (e). Generally, a student who\nenters Wisconsin to attend any educational institution will continue in\nthe nonresident status until the student's reason for being in\nWisconsin is clearly shown to be non-educational. Twelve months after\nthe change in the student's reason for being in Wisconsin,\nthe student may wish to inquire about appealing their nonresident\nstatus. What is Documentation of Physical Presence? Documentation of Physical\nPresence is used to establish the fact that a person\nhas been physically residing in Wisconsin continuously during a specific\nperiod of time. Each item of documentation must include your\nname and a date within the period of time in\nquestion. Examples of some types of documentation of your physical\npresence in Wisconsin follow. You are not limited to these\nexamples, however, and may submit other records more appropriate in\nyour situation. Check with our office to verify that records\nnot included on this list will suffice. We understand the\ndifficulty some may have in producing these documents, but we\nmust include them with your records to satisfy residency audits.\nYou may submit copies of your documentation rather than originals\nwith the exception of letters written on your behalf. In\nmost cases, several items per month will suffice. It may\nsometimes be necessary, however, to request additional documentation depending on\nindividual circumstances. Appropriate documents include: Cancelled checks you wrote to\nlocal businesses or credit card receipts you signed with charges\nto local businesses. Bank statements showing ATM transactions in Wisconsin,\nif the account is only in your name. Credit card\nstatements showing purchases in Wisconsin, if the account is only\nin your name.

A person with a first-time\nconviction of possession of a controlled substance can be sentenced\nup to one year in prison and fined up to\n$5,000, Wisconsin Statute 961.41 (3r)(a). The penalties vary according to\nthe amount of a drug confiscated, the type of drug\nfound, the number of previous offenses by the individual intended\nto manufacture the drug, sell the drug or use the\ndrug. See Wisconsin Statute 961.41. In addition to the stringent\npenalties for possession or delivery, the sentence can be doubled\nwhen exacerbating factors are present, such as when a person\ndistributes a controlled substance to a minor, Wisconsin 961.46. Substance\nrestrictions against alcohol abuse also exist in Wisconsin. It is\nagainst the law to sell alcohol to anyone who has\nnot reached the legal drinking age of 21 and there\nis a concurrent duty on the part of an adult\nto prevent the illegal consumption of alcohol on his/her premises,\nWisconsin Statute 125.07(1)(a)(1). Violation of this statute can result in\na $500 forfeiture. It is against the law for an\nunderage person to attempt to buy an alcoholic beverage, falsely\nrepresent his/her age or enter licensed premise and can be\nfined $1,250, ordered to participate in a supervised work program,\nand have their drivers license suspended, Wisconsin Statute 125.07(4). Harsher\npenalties exist for the retailers of alcoholic beverages, including up\nto 90 days in jail and revocation of his/her retail\nliquor permit. Federal The federal government has recently revised the\npenalties against drug possession and trafficking through its Federal Sentencing\nGuidelines that reduce the discretion that federal judges may use\nin sentencing offenders of federal drug statutes. Under these guidelines,\ncourts can sentence a person for up to 6 years\nfor unlawful possession of a controlled substance, including the distribution\nof a small amount (less than 250 grams) of marijuana.\nA sentence of life imprisonment can result from a conviction\nof possession of a controlled substance that result in death\nor bodily injury. Possession of more than 5 grams of\ncocaine can trigger an intent to distribute penalty of 10-16\nyears in prison, U.S.S.G.s.2D2.0(b)(1).

Link to Wallethub article: https://wallethub.com/credit-cards/citibank/#expert=William_Burnett Why would a credit\ncard company offer 1% cash back on purchases and 1%\ncash back when cardholders pay the balances resulting from those\npurchases, rather than just 2% cash back at either point?\nNormally a credit card company makes money when cardholders revolve\ntheir balances. Incenting cardholders to pay off balances would make\nsense if, for risk reasons, you wanted certain cardholders to\nmaintain a zero revolving balance. What are the benefits and\ndrawbacks of a credit card advertising no late fees ever?\nYoud expect this would resonate with cardholders who felt there\nwas a risk that they would not be able to\nmake payments. The issuer may be covering themselves with high\nrevolving interest rates or some other kind of fee. It\nalso could be where the issuer is operating in a\ncountry where well-heeled cardholders typically will travel for extended periods\nand normally would go a number of payment cycles without\nmaking a payment. It may be a competitive advantage to\noffer no late fees to these customers. Citi now has\nthe Costco credit card account, which used to be with\nAmerican Express; what does that mean for the two companies\nas well as for consumers? Consumers did not have a\nvoice in the change Costco made in 2016. Nevertheless, the\nCiti card offers nice benefits associated with shopping at Costco,\nbetter than with American Express. But a qualified Costco consumer\ncan get the best of both worlds by using the\nCiti/Costco cobrand for purchases at Costco and the AMEX Blue\nCash Preferred card for other supermarket purchases and some other\ncategories.

I attended UW - Parkside as\na second- year transfer student after deciding I'd like to\nlive closer to home. I wasn't sure what I wanted\nto do as a major until I received a call\nfrom the Theatre department to try out for their program\nwhich ultimately made me decide to stay there. Favorite UW-Parkside\nmemory? My favorite memory was when I was able to\nportray Hermia in A Midsummer Nights Dream when it was\nperforming within our Theatre Arts department. The cast and crew\nI was able to work with was amazing and the\nrole has always held a special place in my heart\nlong after. How did your UW-Parkside experience impact your professional\nor personal life? UW - Parkside really impacted my life.\nI have made life-long friends throughout those years. I met\nmy husband through our Theatre Arts department who is absolutely\namazing and has supported me on my journey. Fun Fact:\nWe got married in Dublin, Ireland in a castle! When\nit comes to my profession, I honestly wasn't sure what\nmy path would be after graduating. I received a Bachelor\nof Arts degree with having majored in Theatre Arts (minors\nin German and International Studies). I always knew I wanted\nto stay connected with artists and to start something for\nmyself from scratch. I just didn't know it would be\nthis business until a few years later. The theatre department\nreally prepared me when it came to connecting with individuals,\nbeing confident in my work as well as myself, and\nteaching me various life-long skills that I still use to\nthis day. Professional and Personal Insights Who has had the\nbiggest influence on your life or your career and why?\nMy mom has been my biggest influence. She is an\nartist and free- spirit and always told me to do\nwhat I wanted to do. If I didn't love it,\ndon't do it. I've always been surrounded with that kind\nof influence which helped me realize that I wanted to\nfeature women artisans within this boutique. Advice for current UW-Parkside\nstudents? My advice is that if you have a vision,\ndon't hesitate to go for it. You never know what\ncan happen within a day or a year. If you\ndon't try, how would you know whether it would have\nworked out or not? If you research, put in the\nwork, and maybe even fail a few times, you will\nget to where you want to be. It's all about\nexperiencing and growing as an individual. Who Are You?

As the\nfirst major university to offer this online option in sustainability\neducation, we take pride in preparing students to serve as\nleaders who are eco-literate and capable of dealing directly with\nreal-world problems, said Crystal Fey, UW Sustainable Management program manager.\nWe realize the financial impact a college education has on\nstudents and families. These scholarships were created to relieve some\nof the financial burden and reward students for their dedication\nand hard work.

These scholarship opportunities are a one-time\nopportunity for new students. To be eligible, students must be\ntaking their first course in the Sustainable Management bachelors program.\nContinuing students in the bachelors program may apply for the\nSustainable Management Academic Scholarship. This scholarship is for students who\nhave completed at least two courses in the program and\ncarry a minimum 3.0 GPA. The scholarship award is determined\nby the number of courses a student has completed \nthe more courses taken, the greater the reward. The Sustainable\nManagement Academic Scholarship is available on an ongoing basis. To\nlearn more about the scholarship award amounts, visit the UW\nSustainable Management website. Students may earn a baccalaureate degree, masters\ndegree, or certificates in the UW Sustainable Management program. The\nscholarships apply only to the bachelors degree.

View All\nEvents Counseling Services: Sexual Assault Am I A Victim? |\nWhere Can I Get Help? | What Are Campus Policies?\nWhere Can I Get More Information? Am I A Victim?\nThis page contains information about the nature of sexual assault.\nIt is intended to help answer some questions you might\nhave if you think you are or may have been\na victim. This information is only a tool to help\nyou better understand issues of sexual assault. If you think\nthat you or someone you know might be a victim\nof sexual assault, PLEASE GET HELP! Definition Sexual assault can\ntake many forms including rape or attempted rape, as well\nas any unwanted sexual contact or threats. Usually a sexual\nassault occurs when someone touches any part of another persons\nbody in a sexual way without that persons consent. This\ncan even include contact through clothes. Some types of sexual\nacts which fall under the category of sexual assault include\nforced sexual intercourse (rape), sodomy (oral or anal sexual acts),\nchild molestation, incest, fondling and attempted rape. Sexual assault in\nany form is a devastating crime. Assailants can be strangers,\nbut are more often acquaintances, friends, or family members. Assailants\ncommit sexual assault by way of violence, threats, coercion, manipulation,\npressure or tricks. Whatever the circumstances, no one asks or\ndeserves to be sexually assaulted. Legal Considerations In most state\nstatutes, the term sexual assault has replaced the term rape.\nThis was intended to be more gender-neutral and to include\nmore specific types of sexual victimization and various levels of\ncoercion. Some state codes define First Degree Sexual Assault or\nAggravated Sexual Assault as physically or psychologically forced vaginal, anal\nor oral penetration. This has typically been referred to as\nrape. Sexual Abuse, Sexual Misconduct, Sodomy, Lascivious Acts, Indecent Contact,\nand Indecent Exposure are all examples of sexual assault charges.\nAlmost any sexual behavior to which a person has not\nconsented, or that causes that person to feel uncomfortable, frightened\nor intimidated can be included in the sexual assault category.\nThe law generally assumes that a person does not consent\nto sexual conduct if he or she is forced, threatened,\nunconscious, under the influence of a substance, a minor, developmentally\ndisabled, chronically mentally ill, or believed they are undergoing a\nmedical procedure. What kind of acts can be sexual assault?\nSomeone putting their finger, tongue, mouth, penis or any other\nobject in or on your vagina, penis or anus when\nyou dont want them to; Someone touching, fondling, kissing or\nmaking any unwanted contact with your body; Someone forcing you\nto perform oral sex or forcing you to receive oral\nsex; Someone forcing you to masturbate, forcing you to masturbate\nthem, or fondling and touching you; Someone forcing you to\nlook at sexually explicit material or forcing you to pose\nfor sexually explicit pictures; A doctor, nurse, or other health\ncare professional giving you an unnecessary internal examination or touching\nyour sexual organs in an unprofessional, unwarranted and inappropriate manner.\nReactions of Sexual Assault Victims Since each person is different,\nvictims of sexual assault will respond to an assault in\ndifferent ways. Many factors can influence an individuals response to,\nand recovery from, sexual assault. These may include the age\nand developmental maturity of the victim, the social support network\navailable to the victim, the victims relationship to the offender,\nthe response to the attack by police, medical personnel, and\nvictim advocates, the response to the attack by the victims\nloved ones, the frequency, severity and duration of the assault(s),\nthe setting of the attack; the level of violence and\ninjury inflicted, the response by the criminal justice system; community\nattitudes and values, and the meaning attributed to the traumatic\nevent by the sexual assault survivor (Koss & Harvey, 1991).\nSome survivors of sexual assault will find they can recover\nrelatively quickly, while others will feel the lasting effects of\ntheir victimization throughout their lifetime. Possible Effects of Sexual Assault\nPain Injuries Nausea Vomiting Headaches Shock/denial Irritability/anger Depression Social withdrawal\nNumbing/apathy (detachment, loss of caring) Restricted affect (reduced ability to\nexpress emotions) Nightmares/flashbacks Difficulty concentrating Diminished interest in activities or\nsex Loss of self-esteem Loss of security/loss of trust in\nothers Guilt/shame/embarrassment Impaired memory Loss of appetite Suicidal ideation (thoughts\nof suicide and death) Substance Abuse Psychological disorders Possible Physiological\nEffects of Sexual Assault Hypervigilance (always being \"on your guard\")\nInsomnia Exaggerated startle response (jumpiness) Panic attacks Eating problems/disorders Self-mutilation\n(cutting, burning or otherwise hurting oneself) Sexual dysfunction (not being\nable to perform sexual acts) Hyperarousal (exaggerated feelings/responses to stimuli)\nIn addition, a survivor of sexual assault may develop Rape-related\nPosttraumatic Stress Disorder (RR-PTSD). According to the National Womens Study,\nnearly one-third of all rape victims develop RR-PTSD sometime during\ntheir lifetimes (National Center for Victims of Crime & Crime\nVictims Research and Treatment Center, 1992). PTSD is a psychological\ndisorder characterized by chronic anxiety, depression and flashbacks which develop\nafter experiencing a significant trauma such as a sexual assault.\nRR-PTSD is diagnosed by a mental health professional when the\nbiological, psychological and social effects of trauma are severe enough\nto have impaired a survivors social and occupational functioning (Allen,\n1995 p.169). What should you do if you are sexually\nassaulted? It is important that the victim of sexual assault\nunderstand that no matter where they were, when they were\nthere, what they were wearing, or what they said or\ndid, if they did not want the sexual contact, the\nassault was not their fault. Persons who commit sexual assault\ndo so out of a need to control, dominate, abuse\nand humiliate. Sexual assault is the articulation of aggression through\nsex, and has little to do with passion, lust, desire,\nor sexual arousal. Survivors of sexual assault, react in many\ndifferent ways following the assault(s). Whatever the reaction, it may\nbe helpful for the victim of sexual assault to call\na friend, relative, partner, the police, or an advocate specifically\ntrained in assisting victims of sexual assault. Some prosecutors offices,\npolice departments, and local sexual assault program have trained advocates\nwho work with sexual assault victims and can provide a\nvariety of services including: Accompaniment to the hospital, during the\nrape exam and to the police station; Information about reporting\nprocedures and what to expect; Legal advocacy and court accompaniment;\nEmergency crisis intervention, counseling and referrals; Counseling for the victims\npartner, spouse or family; Assistance in finding care for children;\nand Information about sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and pregnancy testing.\nImmediately after an assault, it is most important that the\nvictim find a safe place, such as a neighbor or\nfriends house, police station, or hospital. If the assault occurred\nin the home, the house should be secured as soon\nas possible by locking all the doors and windows. If\na survivor is hurt, it is imperative to either immediately\ndial 911 to request an ambulance or have a trusted\nfriend or relative transport the survivor to the nearest medical\nfacility for evaluation and treatment. Reporting the Assault(s) The decision\nto report a sexual assault lies within the discretion of\nthe survivor. If a sexual assault survivor plans to report\nthe assault to law enforcement, it is crucial to maintain\nevidence. To do this the victim should never do the\nfollowing before getting advice from law enforcement: Shower, bathe, or\ndouche; Throw away any clothes that were worn at the\ntime of the assault; Brush or comb their hair; Use\nthe restroom; Brush their teeth or gargle; Put on makeup;\nClean or straighten up the crime scene; and Eat or\ndrink anything. If planning to report, it may prove helpful\nfor the survivor to immediately write down everything they can\nremember about the assault including: what the assailant(s) looked like\n(e.g., height, weight, scars, tattoos, hair color, clothes); any unusual\nodor; any noticeable signs of intoxication; anything the assailant(s) said\nduring the assault; what kinds of sexual activities were demanded\nand/or carried out; what kinds of weapons, threats or physical\nforce were used; and any special traits noticed (e.g., limp,\nspeech impediments, use of slang, lack of erection, etc.) (Johnson,\n1985). Writing it down will not only aid the survivor\nin recalling details should they be required to testify, but\nit also gives the sexual assault survivor an active role\nin the investigation, which can provide a feeling of empowerment\nand an element of control in a situation where control\nhad previously been taken away. What to expect when you\nreport a sexual assault. The survivor who reports the assault\nto the authorities will most likely have to undergo a\nsexual assault forensic examination, sometimes called a \"rape kit.\" During\nthis procedure a doctor or nurse will collect the evidence\nnecessary to establish that a crime occurred and, if possible,\nestablish who committed the crime. To do so, the nurse\nor doctor will perform an internal examination (either vaginally, anally\nor both) taking swabs of any secretions left by the\nperpetrator and will do the same to the victims mouth\nif any oral contact was made during the assault. In\naddition, samples of the victims hair and pubic hair will\nbe sampled from the root. On many occasions, several hairs\nneed to be collected, so some discomfort may be possible.\nThe pubic hair will also be combed through to collect\nany additional hair, secretions, or other foreign matter. The clothes\nthe victim was wearing may also be held as evidence,\nso it is a good idea for the survivor to\nbring a change of clothes to the hospital. A series\nof photographs will also be taken of the victim, including\nareas where there are bruises, scrapes or cuts. A victim\nwho chooses to report the assault will be asked to\ndescribe the assault in detail to several different officers and\ninvestigators. The survivor may also have to tell a nurse\nwhat happened, and may want to share their feelings with\nan advocate. If the case is pursued, the survivor will\nbe interviewed by the prosecutors office, and may have to\ntake part in hearings in which the victim is asked\nquestions about the assault. The sexual assault survivor who plans\nto prosecute should know it may take months or years\nfor a case to go to trial, so he or\nshe should be prepared to talk about their victimization many\ntimes before ever having to testify before a trial jury\nor judge. Why you should report a sexual assault. It\nis the fear of intrusive court procedures that prevent many\nsexual assault survivors from reporting their assault(s). Many factors contribute\nto under-reporting including shame and embarrassment, self-blame, fear of media\nexposure, fear of further injury or retaliation, and fear of\na legal system that often puts the victims behavior and\nhistory on trial. A majority of states now have laws\ncalled \"rape-shield\" statutes, which prohibit any non-relevant evidence of the\nvictims past sexual history from being used by the defense\nat trial. There are benefits to reporting sexual assaults which\ninclude being eligible for state crime victim compensation funds. If\na victim is eligible, these funds can possibly pay for\nthe sexual assault forensic examination; other medical expenses; one-time or\nongoing sexually transmitted disease testing; psychological counseling and treatment; lost\nwages; and other services and assistance. In addition, many sexual\nassault survivors report that choosing to follow through with prosecution\ncontributes to a feeling of accomplishment and empowerment because they\nare attempting to protect themselves and others in the community\nfrom being victimized. Many victims also report the attempt to\nput their assailant(s) in jail allows for a feeling of\nclosure, enabling them to put the assault behind them (Johnson,\n1985). Moreover, it is only through individuals reporting sexual assaults\nthat pressure can be placed on the legal system and\nthe community at large to reduce the negative consequences on\nvictims who report sexual assaults. If individuals who commit sexual\nassault offenses are not apprehended and prosecuted, they will continue\nto commit sexual offenses. One widely recognized study found that\n126 admitted rapists had committed 907 rapes involving 882 different\nvictims (Abel et al., 1987). HIV/AIDS and the Sexual Assault\nSurvivor A concern of many survivors of sexual assault is\nthe possibility of contracting HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\nAccording to the National Womens Study, 40% of rape victims\nwere significantly concerned about contracting HIV as a result of\ntheir assault. Though the actual risk of transmission from a\nsingle act of sexual assault is very low, the psychological\nstressor of possible HIV infection is quite significant for the\nsurvivor of sexual assault (Gostin et al., 1994). If the\nsurvivor wishes to be tested for HIV, he or she\nshould talk to a trained advocate or HIV/AIDS professional counselor\nabout the testing process and options. In most cases if\na victim has contracted HIV, he or she will test\npositive within two weeks of the assault. In some instances\nit may take up to three months for a positive\ntest result. If the victim decides to be tested, it\nis important to locate an anonymous testing site. If the\nfirst test result is negative, follow-up testing should be conducted\nthree months, six months and one year after the assault.\nMany victims also wish to know the HIV status of\ntheir assailant. Most states allow for testing of alleged and\nconvicted sex offenders and disclosure of the results to the\nvictim. References Abel, Gene, et al.

Fire alarms\nwill not be used during a tornado warning. Faculty/Staff Role\nFaculty and staff play a vital role in the success\nof an emergency evacuation. An emergency evacuation cannot be successful\nwithout the complete cooperation of all faculty and staff members.\nFaculty and staff, as employees of UW-Parkside, have an obligation\nto help evacuate students and guests. To accomplish this, faculty\nand staff must be familiar with their evacuation routes before\nan alarm is sounded. Consult Emergency Information Signs posted in\nuniversity buildings for evacuation routes. Advise Students It is important\nfor instructors to advise their students on the first day\nof class about evacuation procedures. Stress the importance of evacuation,\nit can be the difference between life and death. Other\nstaff members should advise students, new employees, and visitors of\nour evacuation procedures. Fire Alarm Pull-Station Knowing the location and\noperation of a fire alarm pull-station is essential. Instantly sounding\nthe alarm at the first sign of fire, smoke or\nspilled chemicals is critical. Rapid initiation of an alarm may\nmean the difference between life and death. When an emergency\nevacuation is required, the fire alarm must be sounded by\nactivating a \"pull-station.\" Alarm pull-stations are most commonly found near\nexits and stairwells. Simple directions on its use are written\non the pull-station. Know where pull-stations are located in the\nareas that you frequent on campus. The person who activates\na fire alarm pull-station should call University Police from a\nsafe location to report the nature of the emergency. That\nperson should also meet emergency responders outside the building to\ninform them of the location of the emergency. Evacuation Upon\nhearing a fire alarm, faculty and staff must immediately begin\nevacuating the affected building. Notify persons with hearing impairments of\nthe need to evacuate. Many things may have to be\ncompleted simultaneously. The following actions must be taken by faculty\nand staff during an evacuation. Remain Calm Although the sounding\nof an alarm is stressful, remember to remain calm when\nthe evacuation starts. Panic is contagious during a disaster. The\nantidote for panic is knowing what action to take and\nthe confidence shown in providing directions to others. Your calm\nappearance and clear directions to others will help control the\nsituation. Stop Stop what you are doing. Instructors must stop\nclass immediately. Staff members must cease working. Start the evacuation\nwithout hesitation. Do not call University Police to see if\nit is \"real.\" Always assume it is! Advise Students/Guests Advise\nstudents to take personal property that is within their reach\nand will not hamper the evacuation. Items such as jackets\nand books may be taken. Advise them where to meet\noutside the building. Faculty take your class rosters with you\nto account for your students. Shut Equipment Off Quickly shut\noff hazardous equipment such as Bunsen burners and kilns in\nthe science and art departments. This does NOT apply to\nlarge appliances that are normally left on such as refrigerators,\ncomputers, etc. Close Doors/Windows Close all doors/windows as you leave.\nThis will help contain the fire and smoke. DO NOT\nlock doors. Locked doors will hamper the response of emergency\npersonnel. Evacuate Students/Guests Faculty/staff should immediately begin to evacuate students/guests\nthrough the proper exits. The closest exit is the proper\nexit. Try to move with the flow of pedestrian traffic.\nPeople going in opposite directions leads to confusion. If an\nexit or stairway is becoming crowded, direct students/guests to the\nnext safest and closest exit. Walk quickly and orderly to\nexit the building. Only persons with disabilities may evacuate to\nanother building. All others must evacuate to the outside of\nthe complex. Do Not Use Elevators Please use discretion before\nusing an elevator during an emergency situation. Elevators can stall\nor stop during an emergency situation and become a deadly\ntrap for the occupants. Elevators are programmed to not stop\non any floor where smoke is detected. Persons With Disabilities\nAssist persons with disabilities in exiting the building or move\npersons with mobility impairments to \"Safe Haven\"* areas and notify\nemergency responders of that person's location. Keep Your Distance Evacuate\nand move away from the building to provide easy access\nfor emergency responders. Faculty and staff must request that students/guests\nmove away from the building. Never enter, or allow anyone\nto enter, a building when an alarm is sounding. Do\nnot re-enter until emergency personnel announce that the building is\n\"all-clear\" or the alarm has been silenced. * Contact the\nSafety Coordinator at extension 2262 for more information on \"Safe\nHaven\" areas.
